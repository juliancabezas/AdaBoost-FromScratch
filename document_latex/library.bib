abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with highly heterogeneous environments can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In this view, spatial variability extracted from remotely sensed images has been used as a proxy of species diversity, as these data provide an inexpensive means of deriving environmental information for large areas in a consistent and regular manner. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the use of spectral heterogeneity for estimating species diversity. We will examine a number of issues related to this theme, dealing with: i) the main sensors used for biodiversity monitoring, ii) scale matching problems between remotely sensed and field diversity data, iii) spectral heterogeneity measurement techniques, iv) types of species taxonomic diversity measures and how they influence the relationship between spectral and species diversity, v) spectral versus genetic diversity, and vi) modeling procedures for relating spectral and species diversity. Our review suggests that remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity information provides a crucial baseline for rapid estimation or prediction of biodiversity attributes and hotspots in space and time. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper we apply the recently introduced Random Forest-Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm to the identification of relevant features in the spectra produced by Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) analysis of agroindustrial products. The method is compared with the more traditional Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), extended to allow multiclass problems, and with a baseline method based on the Kruskal–Wallis statistic (KWS). In particular, we apply all selection methods to the discrimination of nine varieties of strawberries and six varieties of typical cheeses from Trentino Province, North Italy. Using replicated experiments we estimate unbiased generalization errors. Our results show that RF-RFE outperforms SVM-RFE and KWS on the task of finding small subsets of features with high discrimination levels on PTR-MS data sets. We also show how selection probabilities and features co-occurrence can be used to highlight the most relevant features for discrimination.},

abstract = {Random Forests are considered for classification of multisource remote sensing and geographic data. Various ensemble classification methods have been proposed in recent years. These methods have been proven to improve classification accuracy considerably. The most widely used ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. Boosting is based on sample re-weighting but bagging uses bootstrapping. The Random Forest classifier uses bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, to form an ensemble of classification and regression tree (CART)-like classifiers. In addition, it searches only a random subset of the variables for a split at each CART node, in order to minimize the correlation between the classifiers in the ensemble. This method is not sensitive to noise or overtraining, as the resampling is not based on weighting. Furthermore, it is computationally much lighter than methods based on boosting and somewhat lighter than simple bagging. In the paper, the use of the Random Forest classifier for land cover classification is explored. We compare the accuracy of the Random Forest classifier to other better-known ensemble methods on multisource remote sensing and geographic data. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Land use and cover change (LUCC) is among the most important factors affecting ecosystem services. This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0-100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest. As a result of these landscape changes, recreation and ecotourism opportunities for the entire landscape were reduced from 65,050 persons in 1976 to 25,038 persons in 1985, further declining to 22,346 and 21,608 persons in 1999 and 2007, respectively. This decrease resulted from changes in specific attributes (i.e. emblematic flora and fauna and forest structure) that were affected by forest degradation and fragmentation. These results highlight the substantial impact of LUCC on recreation opportunity decline, which mirrors biodiversity losses in the study area. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Household consumption and direct-use values of a range of savanna bio-resources were quantified for 110 households across three villages in the Mametja Traditional Authority, Limpopo province, South Africa. The relationship between household wealth status and use of natural resources was also assessed. We found that the use of natural resources was extensive, the most common being wooden utensils, grass handbrooms, twig handbrooms, fuelwood, wild herbs, wild fruit and edible insects. Households in the poorest of the three villages consumed the most wooden utensils, wild herbs, wild fruit and thatching grass. Fuelwood was widely used, even though two of the three villages had electricity, and consumption was highest in the largest, most developed village. The mean annual direct-use value of indigenous bio-resources, averaged across all households, was R3959 per household or R564 per person. The value was highest in the poorest of the three villages. Poor households relied most heavily on 'essential' natural resources such as wild foods, whereas comparatively wealthy households used a wider range of resources and utilized greater amounts of 'luxury' items, such as wooden utensils and poles. These findings are discussed in the context of poverty and sustainable rural development, and should be of value to scientists, community developers, and policy-makers.},

abstract = {Alien conifer invasions are affecting ecosystems across the globe, but until recently, reports of such invasions in South America were scarce. Pinus contorta was first established in Chilean Patagonia for erosion control caused by historical fires and cattle farming. Recently, the species has been planted over large areas for commercial purposes. It is well adapted to local conditions and is now spreading into natural areas. This study analyzes natural regeneration of Pinus contorta around Coyhaique city, Chile, to determine the spatial patterns of invasion. Five study sites were selected, four with grasslands dominated by exotic species and one site in the steppe. In each site, the plantation (seed source) was characterized using morphological attributes and density. Regeneration, density, height and age at different distances from the seed source were recorded, and ground cover was measured as an environmental factor influencing the invasion process. A comparative analysis was also conducted between the situation in Chile and other countries affected by P. contorta invasion. In Chile, P. contorta regeneration is significantly influenced by distance from the seed source. Higher densities are found close to the parent stand (up to 13,222 trees ha(-1)), decreasing as distance from the seed source increases. Age and height structure indicate that the invasion process is at an early stage, and this offers a unique opportunity to study the process of invasion and to monitor it over time. In order to preserve the distinctiveness of Patagonian ecosystem, decisive action is required to control invasive conifers, with P. contorta as the number one priority. Relative to control, there is much that can be learnt from the experiences of other countries, such as New Zealand.

abstract = {Fusion of optical and SAR time series imagery has the potential to improve forest monitoring in tropical regions, where cloud cover limits optical satellite time series observations. We present a novel pixel-based Multi-sensor Time-series correlation and Fusion approach (MulTiFuse) that exploits the full observation density of optical and SAR time series. We model the relationship of two overlapping univariate time series using an optimized weighted correlation. The resulting optimized regression model is used to predict and fuse two time series. Using the MulTiFuse approach we fused Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter time series. We subsequently used the fused time series in a multi-sensor change detection framework to detect deforestation between 01/2008 - 09/2010 at a managed forest plantation in the tropics (Pinus caribea; 2859ha). 3-monthly reference data covering the entire study area was used to validate and assess spatial and temporal accuracy. We tested the impact of persistent cloud cover by increasing the per-pixel missing data percentage of the NDVI time series stepwise from $\sim$53% ($\sim$6 observations/year) up to 95% ($\sim$0.5 observation/year) while fusing with a consistent PALSAR time series of $\sim$2 observations/year. A significant linear correlation was found between the Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band SAR time series observables for logged forest. The multi-temporal filtered PALSAR HVHH backscatter ratio time series (HVHHmt) was most strongly correlated with the NDVI time series. While for Landsat-only the spatial and temporal accuracy of detected deforestation decreased significantly with increasing missing data, the accuracies for the fused NDVI-PALSAR case remained high and were observed to be above the NDVI- and PALSAR-only cases for all missing data percentages. For the fused NDVI-HVHHmt time series the overall accuracy was 95.5% with a 1.59month mean time lag of detected changes. The MulTiFuse approach is robust and automated, and it provides the opportunity to use the upcoming data streams of free-of charge, medium resolution optical and SAR satellite imagery in a beneficial way for improved tropical forest monitoring.},

First, a new TCT based on a new data set from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager top of atmosphere (OLI TOA) reflectance was developed. Then, a case study of the Yellow River Delta, China, demonstrated that TCT parameters derived from a Landsat 8 OLI TOA reference image from May 2013 were probably applicable to clear and nearly cloud-free images for spring, summer, and autumn over the Yellow River Delta.

abstract = {Stretching over 4300 km north to south, Chile is a special country with complicated landscapes and rich biodiversity. Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.},

The balance of CH4 and CO2 exchange can provide an index of a wetland's greenhouse gas (carbon) contribution to the atmosphere. Here. we relate the atmospheric global warming potential of methane (GWP(M)) with annual methane emission carbon dioxide exchange ratio of wetlands ranging from the boreal zone to the near-subtropics, This relationship permits one to determine the greenhouse carbon balance of wetlands by their contribution to or attenuation of the greenhouse effect via CH4 emission or CO2 sink, respectively, We report annual measurements of the relationship between methane emission and net carbon fixation in three wetland ecosystems. The ratio of methane released to annual net carbon fixed varies from 0.05 to 0.20 on a molar basis. Although these wetlands function as a sink for CO2, the 21.8-fold greater infrared absorptivity of CH4 relative to CO2 (GWP(M)) over a relatively short time horizon (20 years) would indicate that the release of methane still contributes to the overall greenhouse effect, As GWP(M) decreases over longer time horizons ( 100 years), our analyses suggest that the subtropical and temperate wetlands attenuate global warming. and northern wetlands may be perched on the "greenhouse compensation" point. Considering a 500-year time horizon, these wetlands can be regarded as sinks for greenhouse gas warming potential, and thus attenuate the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Development activities in Altamira, Para, Brazil began with the construction of the Transamazon Highway in 1970. In the early years land use emphasized annual crops, followed by pasture development. During the second decade of settlement, land cover in the region shifted from 'degraded pastures' or early stages of secondary successional vegetation to increased dominance of intermediate and late secondary succession. This finding is a result of recent research using Landsat TM satellite data and detailed field studies of vegetation stand structure. Close to 40% of the forest had been removed by 1985, but between 1985 and 1991 there is clear evidence for twice as much regrowth as there is new deforestation. Land use has a significant effect on the vegetation's total height, stem height, and basal area. The use of satellite data in combination with detailed studies of vegetation stand structure and land use histories gathered from households provide a multilevel approach that allows integration of local, regional, and global patterns of secondary succession in agricultural areas, and informs restoration strategies for Amazonia.},

abstract = {National Forests and Water Guidelines require the establishment of riparian buffers to help protect the freshwater environment from disturbance by silvicultural operations on the adjacent land. The main functions of the riparian buffer are considered to be sediment removal and erosion control, protection of water quality, moderation of shade and water temperature, maintenance of habitat structural diversity and ecological integrity, and improvement of landscape quality. This review paper assesses how these functions are affected by the design and management of the riparian forest zone, with a focus on the width of the buffer, the structure of the vegetation and species choice. It is not possible to specify a definitive riparian buffer width that will protect the freshwater environment from every potential threat. Forestry agencies usually recommend widths between 10 and 30 m. Buffer widths towards the lower end of this scale tend to protect the physical and chemical characteristics of a stream, while the maintenance of ecological integrity requires widths at the upper end. In terms of structure and species, the benefits are greatest where the riparian buffer replicates native riparian woodland with an open canopy of mixed species of varied age class. The optimum level of shade is difficult to quantify but limited work suggests that a good balance is achieved where around 50% of the stream surface is open to sunlight and the remainder covered by dappled shade. Within the management of riparian woodland there is a need to consider a stream's sensitivity and intrinsic value. Some sites will benefit from active intervention such as thinning, coppicing or pollarding, while others will be favoured by a hands-off approach. Long-term continuity of management is important to ensure that the potential benefits to the freshwater environment are realised.},

abstract = {Using a spectral vegetation index (VI) is an efficient approach for monitoring plant phenology from remotely-sensed data. However, the quantitative biophysical meaning of most VIs is still unclear, and, particularly at high northern latitudes characterized by low green biomass renewal rate and snow-affected VI signals, it is difficult to use them for tracking seasonal vegetation growth and retrieving phenology. In this study we propose a physically-based new vegetation index for characterizing terrestrial vegetation canopy green leaf area dynamics: the plant phenology index (PPI). PPI is derived from the solution to a radiative transfer equation, is computed from red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, and has a nearly linear relationship with canopy green leaf area index (LAI), enabling it to depict canopy foliage density well. This capability is verified with stacked-leaf measurements, canopy reflectance model simulations, and field LAI measurements from international sites. Snow influence on PPI is shown by modeling and satellite observations to be less severe than on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), while soil brightness variations in general have moderate influence on PPI. Comparison of satellite-derived PPI to ground observations of plant phenology and gross primary productivity (GPP) shows strong similarity of temporal patterns over several Nordic boreal forest sites. The proposed PPI can thus serve as an efficient tool for estimating plant canopy growth, and will enable improved vegetation monitoring, particularly of evergreen needle-leaf forest phenology at high northern latitudes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This PE&RS Special Issue provides an update to the 1997 25th Landsat anniversary issue, particularly focused on the contribution of Landsat-7 to the 34+ year history of the Landsot mission. In this overview paper, we place the Landsat-7 system in context and show how mission operations have changed over time, increasingly exploiting the global monitoring capabilities of the Landsat observatory. Although considerable progress was made during the Landsat-7 era, there is much yet to learn about the historical record of Landsat global coverage: a truly valuable national treasure. The time to do so is now, as the memories of the early days of this historic program are fading as we speak.},

This contemporary highresolution archive represents a significant, rapidly expanding, cost-free and largely unexploited resource for scientific inquiry. To increase the scientific utility of this archive, we address horizontal positional accuracy (georegistration) by comparing Google Earth with Landsat GeoCover scenes over a global sample of 436 control points located in 109 cities worldwide. Landsat GeoCover is an orthorectified product with known absolute positional accuracy of less than 50 meters root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Relative to Landsat GeoCover, the 436 Google Earth control points have a positional accuracy of 39.7 meters RMSE (error magnitudes range from 0.4 to 171.6 meters). The control points derived from satellite imagery have an accuracy of 22.8 meters RMSE, which is significantly more accurate than the 48 control-points based on aerial photography (41.3 meters RMSE; t-test p-value < 0.01). The accuracy of control points in more-developed countries is 24.1 meters RMSE, which is significantly more accurate than the control points in developing countries (44.4 meters RMSE; t-test p-value < 0.01). These findings indicate that Google Earth highresolution imagery has a horizontal positional accuracy that is sufficient for assessing moderate-resolution remote sensing products across most of the world's peri-urban areas.},

abstract = {The use of global positioning systems (GPS) has increased in recent years, including for urban forestry management, as a result of its wide range of applications, ease of use and direct use of GPS data in geographic information systems. This study was conducted in an urban green space to assess the accuracy and precision of two consumer-grade GPS receivers with regard to ground control point (GCP) coordinates. Eleven fixed GCPs with known positions were selected and their data collected on four days (two seasons) and three different daytime periods (08:00, 11:00 and 14:00) each day. For each treatment (season and daytime) five replications were recorded. The results showed that the best mean position accuracies were provided by the Colorado receiver in leaf-off period (4–5 m), and its corresponding position accuracies for summer ranged from 9 to 12 m. The results of the Rino receiver mean position error in summer (19–36 m) and winter (10–26 m) were higher than reported in literature. Point averaging had a positive effect on accuracy in both receivers for winter. In summer, three-point averaging was more efficient than five-point averaging. During the day, the Colorado receiver had the best positional accuracy at 08:00 in winter, but in summer there was a large variation in the results. For the Rino receiver there was no general trend; however, results taken at 11:00 and 14:00 were better than those at 08:00. Regarding precision, point averaging had a positive effect on the Colorado while the Rino precision indicated the contrary. The Colorado receiver had better precision than the Rino in both seasons, and was the best in summer. The Rino receiver had better precision in summer compared to winter, and in both recievers daytime had no significant effect on precision. The measured accuracies of Colorado are acceptable for many environment and urban forestry measurement applications and satisfy mapping requirements, but the Rino receiver showed poorer results.},

abstract = {Scaling up deep neural network capacity has been known as an effective approach to improving model quality for several different machine learning tasks. In many cases, increasing model capacity beyond the memory limit of a single accelerator has required developing special algorithms or infrastructure. These solutions are often architecture-specific and do not transfer to other tasks. To address the need for efficient and task-independent model parallelism, we introduce GPipe, a pipeline parallelism library that allows scaling any network that can be expressed as a sequence of layers. By pipelining different sub-sequences of layers on separate accelerators, GPipe provides the flexibility of scaling a variety of different networks to gigantic sizes efficiently. Moreover, GPipe utilizes a novel batch-splitting pipelining algorithm, resulting in almost linear speedup when a model is partitioned across multiple accelerators. We demonstrate the advantages of GPipe by training large-scale neural networks on two different tasks with distinct network architectures: (i) Image Classification: We train a 557-million-parameter AmoebaNet model and attain a top-1 accuracy of 84.4% on ImageNet-2012, (ii) Multilingual Neural Machine Translation: We train a single 6-billion-parameter, 128-layer Transformer model on a corpus spanning over 100 languages and achieve better quality than all bilingual models.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Contraction of cardiac myocytes is initiated by Ca(2+) entry through the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC). Previous studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling modulates LTCC function. Because PI 3-kinases are key mediators of insulin action, we investigated whether LTCC function is affected in diabetic animals due to reduced PI 3-kinase signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used whole-cell patch clamping and biochemical assays to compare cardiac LTCC function and PI 3-kinase signaling in insulin-deficient diabetic mice heterozygous for the Ins2(Akita) mutation versus nondiabetic littermates. RESULTS: Diabetic mice had a cardiac contractility defect, reduced PI 3-kinase signaling in the heart, and decreased L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density in myocytes compared with control nondiabetic littermates. The lower I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice is due at least in part to reduced cell surface expression of the LTCC. I(Ca,L) density in myocytes from diabetic mice was increased to control levels by insulin treatment or intracellular infusion of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate PI(3,4,5)P(3). This stimulatory effect was blocked by taxol, suggesting that PI(3,4,5)P(3) stimulates microtubule-dependent trafficking of the LTCC to the cell surface. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of I(Ca,L) was also shifted to more positive potentials in myocytes from diabetic versus nondiabetic animals. PI(3,4,5)P(3) infusion eliminated only the difference in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of I(Ca,L). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased PI 3-kinase signaling in myocytes from type 1 diabetic mice leads to reduced Ca(2+) entry through the LTCC, which might contribute to the negative effect of diabetes on cardiac contractility.},

abstract = {Tropical dry forests are one of the world's most endangered forest types. Currently there are no comparative data on extent or levels of species richness for remaining forest fragments. This research identifies landscape metrics and spectral indices that can be applied at the stand and patch level to predict woody-plant species richness in tropical dry forests. This study was undertaken in 18 stands of tropical dry forest with nine sites in the Florida Keys and nine sites within an urban-agricultural matrix in mainland Florida, USA. Woody-plant species richness was quantified at the stand level (belt transects totaling 500 m(2)) and patch level (presence/absence data for 65 native tropical plants less than or equal to2.5 cm dbh) for all study sites. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images (pixel resolution 30 x 30 m) were used to assess the utility of landscape metrics (forest patch area, nearest neighbor distance, shape index, boundary complexity) and spectral indices (normalized-difference vegetation index [NDVI] for nine pixels and 500 pixels directly over transects, and all pixels in the forest patch area) for predicting stand- and patch-level species richness. The 18 stands of tropical dry forest sampled in this study included 4248 woody plants, representing 71 species. Islands in the Florida Keys had higher levels of woody-plant species richness than mainland sites. There was a significant positive relationship between mean NDVI for the nine pixels over each stand and stand species richness and a significant negative relationship between species richness and standard deviation of NDVI for nine pixels over each stand. The density of evergreen plants explained 66% of the variability in mean NDVI. At the patch level, forest patch area and mean NDVI at the stand, 500-pixel, and patch level were all positively associated with patch species richness. However, combining forest patch area with NDVI significantly improved the prediction of patch species richness. Results from this study support the species-energy theory at the level of a forest stand and patch and suggest that a first-order approximation of woody-plant species richness in stands and patches of tropical dry forest is possible in biodiversity hot spots.},

abstract = {Evidence of shifting dominance among major forest disturbance agent classes regionally to globally has been emerging in the literature. For example, climate-related stress and secondary stressors on forests (e.g., insect and disease, fire) have dramatically increased since the turn of the century globally, while harvest rates in the western US and elsewhere have declined. For shifts to be quantified, accurate historical forest disturbance estimates are required as a baseline for examining current trends. We report annual disturbance rates (with uncertainties) in the aggregate and by major change causal agent class for the conterminous US and five geographic subregions between 1985 and 2012. Results are based on human interpretations of Landsat time series from a probability sample of 7200 plots (30. m) distributed throughout the study area. Forest disturbance information was recorded with a Landsat time series visualization and data collection tool that incorporates ancillary high-resolution data. National rates of disturbance varied between 1.5% and 4.5% of forest area per year, with trends being strongly affected by shifting dominance among specific disturbance agent influences at the regional scale. Throughout the time series, national harvest disturbance rates varied between one and two percent, and were largely a function of harvest in the more heavily forested regions of the US (Mountain West, Northeast, and Southeast). During the first part of the time series, national disturbance rates largely reflected trends in harvest disturbance. Beginning in the mid-90s, forest decline-related disturbances associated with diminishing forest health (e.g., physiological stress leading to tree canopy cover loss, increases in tree mortality above background levels), especially in the Mountain West and Lowland West regions of the US, increased dramatically. Consequently, national disturbance rates greatly increased by 2000, and remained high for much of the decade. Decline-related disturbance rates reached as high as 8% per year in the western regions during the early-2000s. Although low compared to harvest and decline, fire disturbance rates also increased in the early- to mid-2000s. We segmented annual decline-related disturbance rates to distinguish between newly impacted areas and areas undergoing gradual but consistent decline over multiple years. We also translated Landsat reflectance change into tree canopy cover change information for greater relevance to ecosystem modelers and forest managers, who can derive better understanding of forest-climate interactions and better adapt management strategies to changing climate regimes. Similar studies could be carried out for other countries where there are sufficient Landsat data and historic temporal snapshots of high-resolution imagery.},

@techreport{ASTERGDEMValidationTeam2011,
abstract = {On June 29, 2009, NASA and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan released a Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) to users worldwide at no charge as a contribution to the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS). This “version 1” ASTER GDEM (GDEM1) was compiled from over 1.2 million scenebased DEMs covering land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S latitudes. A joint U.S.-Japan validation team assessed the accuracy of the GDEM1, augmented by a team of 20 cooperators. The GDEM1 was found to have an overall accuracy of around 20 meters at the 95% confidence level. The team also noted several artifacts associated with poor stereo coverage at high latitudes, cloud contamination, water masking issues and the stacking process used to produce the GDEM1 from individual scene-based DEMs (ASTER GDEM Validation Team, 2009). Two independent horizontal resolution studies estimated the effective spatial resolution of the GDEM1 to be on the order of 120 meters. A second version of the ASTER GDEM (GDEM2) is scheduled for release by NASA and METI in mid-October, 2011. Improvements in the GDEM2 result from acquiring 260,000 additional scenes to improve coverage, a smaller correlation kernel to yield higher spatial resolution, and improved water masking. As with the GDEM1, the GDEM2 validation was performed by the U.S. and Japanese partners. Vertical accuracy assessments included a comparison of the GDEM2 against absolute geodetic references over the Conterminous US (CONUS), against national elevation grids over the US and Japan, against the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1 arc-second elevation grids over the US and 20 sites around the globe, and against space borne laser altimeter data globally. Horizontal accuracy assessments were conducted as part of the Japan and the global SRTM studies, and horizontal resolution studies were conducted in both Japan and the US. Each group documented changes in artifacts in GDEM2 due to processing improvements. The absolute vertical accuracy study found the GDEM2 to be within -0.20 meters on average when compared against 18,000 geodetic control points over the CONUS, with an accuracy of 17 meters at the 95% confidence level. The Japan study noted the GDEM2 differed from the 10-meter national elevation grid by -0.7 meters over bare areas, and by 7.4 meters over forested areas. Similarly, the CONUS study noted the GDEM2 to be about 8 meters above the 1 arc-second NED over most forested areas, and more than a meter below NED over bare areas. The global altimeter study found the GDEM2 to be on average within 3 meters of altimeter-derived control, and also documented sensitivity to tree canopy height. The Japan study noted that the horizontal displacement in GDEM1 of 0.95 pixels was reduced to 0.23 pixels in GDEM2. Both teams noted improvements in horizontal resolution, between 71 and 82 meters, comparable to the SRTM 1 arc second elevation model, but at the cost of some increased noise. The number of voids and artifacts noted in GDEM1 were substantially reduced in GDEM2, and in some areas virtually eliminated. Based on these findings, the GDEM validation team recommends the release of the GDEM2 to the public, acknowledging that, while vastly improved, some artifacts still exist which could affect its utility in certain applications.},

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

abstract = {Land use and cover change (LUCC) is among the most important factors affecting ecosystem services. This study examines the influence of LUCC on recreation and ecotourism opportunities over three decades in southern Chile. An in-depth analysis of the transition matrix was conducted based on Landsat images from 1976, 1985, 1999 and 2007. Main LUCC trajectories were linked to two ecosystem service indicators: (i) Recreation and ecotourism potential, measured in a 0-100 point scale; and (ii) Recreation and ecotourism opportunities, measured in visitors/ha. A total of 900 trajectories occurred in the landscape between 1976 and 2007. The most important trajectories in terms of area, were the recent degradation of old-growth to secondary forest between 1999 and 2007 (23,290 ha; 13.5 % of landscape), and the early clearing of shrublands for agriculture and pasture land between 1976 and 1985 (7,187 ha, 4.2 % of landscape). In turn, the single most influential trajectory on the magnitude of the indicators was early and permanent degradation of old-growth forest to secondary forest. As a result of these landscape changes, recreation and ecotourism opportunities for the entire landscape were reduced from 65,050 persons in 1976 to 25,038 persons in 1985, further declining to 22,346 and 21,608 persons in 1999 and 2007, respectively. This decrease resulted from changes in specific attributes (i.e. emblematic flora and fauna and forest structure) that were affected by forest degradation and fragmentation. These results highlight the substantial impact of LUCC on recreation opportunity decline, which mirrors biodiversity losses in the study area. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Availability of free, high quality Landsat data portends a new era in remote sensing change detection. Using dense ($\sim$. annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington, USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth. ?? 2010.},

In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (728 projects, 63 million SLOC, 29,000 authors,1.5 million commits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach,combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of language features such as static versus dynamic typing and allowing versus disallowing type confusion on software quality. By triangulating findings from different methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a significant,but modest effect on software quality. Most notably,it does appear that disallowing type confusion is modestly better than allowing it, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language design are overwhelmingly dominated by the process factors such as project size,team size, and commit size. However, we caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possibly be due to other, intangible process factors, for example, the preference of certain personality types for functional, static languages that disallow type confusion.},

Scheidegger (1966. p. 57) reported that the blue stream lines printed on maps are extremely arbitrary and appeared to depend on the channel flow observed to be present by the surveyor or by means of air photographs. When Morisawa (1957) mapped the channel system of a part of the Appalachian Plateaus in spring she found much more running water in channels than was depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey 1:24,000 topographical maps, even when they were produced from air photographs, it being particularly apparent that many flowing fingertip tributaries had been obscured from the air by overhanging trees. The policy of the U.S. Geological Surveys has been to classify all streams as either perennial (i.e. ones that flow throughout the year) or intermittent (i.e. ones that are dry for a considerable time each year, say for three months or longer). Before criticising such a classification as over-simplistic, it is pertinent to consider the problems in identifying a stream channel network in the field and on maps and air photographs.},

abstract = {The understanding and management of biodiversity is often limited by a lack of data. Remote sensing has considerable potential as a source of data on biodiversity at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for biodiversity management. To-date, most remote sensing studies have focused on only one aspect of biodiversity, species richness, and have generally used conventional image analysis techniques that may not fully exploit the data's information content. Here, we report on a study that aimed to estimate biodiversity more fully from remotely sensed data with the aid of neural networks. Two neural network models, feedforward networks to estimate basic indices of biodiversity and Kohonen networks to provide information on species composition, were used. Biodiversity indices of species richness and evenness derived from the remotely sensed data were strongly correlated with those derived from field survey. For example, the predicted tree species richness was significantly correlated with that observed in the field (r=0.69, significant at the 95% level of confidence). In addition, there was a high degree of correspondence (∼83%) between the partitioning of the outputs from Kohonen networks applied to tree species and remotely sensed data sets that indicated the potential to map species composition. Combining the outputs of the two sets of neural network based analyses enabled a map of biodiversity to be produced.},

abstract = {We review the literature and find 16 studies from across Africa's savannas and woodlands where woody encroachment dominates. These small-scale studies are supplemented by an analysis of long-term continent-wide satellite data, specifically the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) dataset. Using dry-season data to separate the tree and grass signals, we find 4.0% of non-rainforest woody vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding West Africa) significantly increased in NDVI from 1982 to 2006, whereas 3.52% decreased. The increases in NDVI were found predominantly to the north of the Congo Basin, with decreases concentrated in the Miombo woodland belt. We hypothesize that areas of increasing dry-season NDVI are undergoing woody encroachment, but the coarse resolution of the study and uncertain relationship between NDVI and woody cover mean that the results should be interpreted with caution; certainly, these results do not contradict studies finding widespread deforestation throughout the continent. However, woody encroachment could be widespread, and warrants further investigation as it has important consequences for the global carbon cycle and land-climate interactions.},

abstract = {Mapping of ephemeral streams in desert environments is crucial to understanding the impacts to hydrologic and ecosystem functions caused by land-use changes. Available mapping methods at the watershed-scale typically underestimate total channel length and the size of channel networks. Although remote sensing is effective for obtaining information on large areas, conventional techniques are often ineffective or cost-prohibitive for complex stream networks in expansive desert regions. Using very-high-spatial-resolution imagery, we developed a new algorithm to map desert ephemeral streams in the southwestern U.S., where utility-scale solar energy development is altering the landscape. Knowledge about landscape features such as shrubs and desert pavement and their spatial arrangement was integrated into the algorithm using spectral transformation and spatial statistical operations. The algorithm extracted ephemeral stream lengths approximately 900% greater than those identified in the National Hydrography Dataset. The accuracy in mapping channel areas and centerlines was as high as 92% and 91%, respectively. Although the algorithm captured detailed stream channels, it often underestimated channels obscured by bright soils and sparse vegetation. Although further improvement is warranted, the algorithm provides an effective means of obtaining detailed information about ephemeral streams, which could make a significant contribution toward improving the hydrological modeling of desert environments.},

The main aim was to analyse the relationship that surface temperature exhibits with land cover types, as well as with vegetation cover fraction, surface moisture and albedo of Santiago City and its rural surroundings. Information was extracted from the processing of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. Surface temperature of the main land cover classes and correlation coefficients between surface temperature and the above?mentioned surface parameters were analysed. The results show that the hottest surfaces are mainly concentrated in the northern rural valley, wherein the predominance of bare or sparsely vegetated land covers determine a low vegetation cover fraction and surface moisture content. The correlation coefficients obtained confirm the higher warming rate that the rural valley exhibits in comparision with the city temperatures at the image acquisition time, which is one of the main causes of urban heat sink formation.},

abstract = {Mediterranean ecosystems are global hotspots of biodiversity threaten by human disturbances. Growing evidence indicates that regeneration of Mediterranean forests can be halted under certain circumstances and that successional stages can become notoriously persistent. The Mediterranean sclerophyllous forest in central Chile is been largely transformed into savannas dominated by the invasive legume tree Acacia caven as result of interacting management and ecological factors. We used multi-temporal satellite imagery to study the transition dynamics of these major vegetation types over the last four decades (1975-2008). Vegetation changes were related to indicators of resource availability (topography, water availability, solar radiance), potential propagule availability (distance to forest remnant patches) and disturbance regimes (grazing, fire occurrence and distance to roads and cities). During this study period, forests were mostly converted into Acacia savannas (46.1%). Acacia savanna was the most persistent natural vegetation type. The probability of sclerophyllous forest degradation into Acacia savanna increased on drier northern-exposed slopes, close to roads and further away from forest remnants. In contrast, forest regeneration from Acacia savanna was higher on moister southern-exposed slopes and closer to forest remnants. Acacia savannas are increasingly being converted into cultivated land on the moister locations or switching into a bare soil state in locations close to cities and further away from forest remnants. These results highlight the vulnerability of diverse sclerophyllous forests and its increasing conversion into persistent Acacia savannas in the Mediterranean region of central Chile and identify the ecological conditions for successful conservation and restoration of the native sclerophyllous forest vegetation that can be used for sensible land use planning. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1 This study examines the effect of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution on the positional accuracy of derived hydrologic networks and quantitatively confirms that DEM resolution should be greater than the average hillslope length when used for hydrologic modeling. Seven hundred kilometers of mapped stream networks are compared to stream networks derived from 17 DEMs with resolutions ranging from 30 m to 3 km. Comparison between predicted and mapped streams reveals that accuracy of predicted stream locations decays quickly beyond a DEM resolution of 180 m. A new application of Gyasi-Agyei et al. 's 1995 DEM resolution suitability test based on average slope and vertical resolution indicates an average hillslope length of between 150 and 180 m. Tarboton et al. 's 1991 method of determining average hillslope length based on slope and accumulation areas reconfirms the length to be 150 m and verifies the link between network accuracy and hillslope scale. Two algorithms are used to derive stream networks: the D-infinity algorithm Tarboton, 1997, which allows for flow dispersion, and the D8 algorithm O'Callaghan and Mark, 1984, which does not. A comparison between the D8 and D 1 algorithms shows that modeling flow dispersion is not necessary in steep terrain, as both algorithms performed equally well. However, the D-infinity algorithm is found to be less susceptible to modeling erroneous hillside flow convergence, making it preferable to the D8 algorithm when used by Tarboton et al. 's 1991 method of determining the average hillslope lengths. Finally, field observation indicates that predicted first- and second-order streams tend to exist when predicted; however, mapped streams have a higher positional accuracy.},

abstract = {We used a spatially nested hierarchy of field and remote-sensing observations and a process model, Biome-BGC, to produce a carbon budget for the forested region of Oregon, and to determine the relative influence of differences in climate and disturbance among the ecoregions on carbon stocks and fluxes. The simulations suggest that annual net uptake (net ecosystem production (NEP)) for the whole forested region (8.2 million hectares) was 13.8 Tg C (168 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), with the highest mean uptake in the Coast Range ecoregion (226 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and the lowest mean NEP in the East Cascades (EC) ecoregion (88 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Carbon stocks totaled 2765 Tg C (33 700 g C m(-2)), with wide variability among ecoregions in the mean stock and in the partitioning above- and belowground. The flux of carbon from the land to the atmosphere that is driven by wildfire was relatively low during the late 1990s (similar to0.1 Tg C yr(-1)), however, wildfires in 2002 generated a much larger C source (similar to4.1 Tg C). Annual harvest removals from the study area over the period 1995-2000 were similar to5.5 Tg C yr(-1). The removals were disproportionately from the Coast Range, which is heavily managed for timber production (approximately 50% of all of Oregon's forest land has been managed for timber in the past 5 years). The estimate for the annual increase in C stored in long-lived forest products and land fills was 1.4 Tg C yr(-1). Net biome production (NBP) on the land, the net effect of NEP, harvest removals, and wildfire emissions indicates that the study area was a sink (8.2 Tg C yr(-1)). NBP of the study area, which is the more heavily forested half of the state, compensated for similar to52% of Oregon's fossil carbon dioxide emissions of 15.6 Tg C yr(-1) in 2000. The Biscuit Fire in 2002 reduced NBP dramatically, exacerbating net emissions that year. The regional total reflects the strong east-west gradient in potential productivity associated with the climatic gradient, and a disturbance regime that has been dominated in recent decades by commercial forestry.},

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

abstract = {Patagonian peatland ecosystems have received very little attention in the scientific literature despite their widespread distribution in the regional landscape and the anthropogenic pressure they experience from the peat extraction industry. The functioning of these southern peatlands is strikingly similar to that of northern peatlands, but they have developed under very different climate boundary conditions. Therefore, studying these ecosystems provides a unique opportunity to test ideas and hypotheses about the sensitivity of carbon-rich peat accumulating ecosystems to climate change, in addition to filling significant data and knowledge gaps. Here we provide a synthesis of detailed peat accumulation records for southern Patagonia using a combination of new peat-core analysis (from 4 sites) and a data review from previously published studies (from 19 sites). We also present the modern climate space (temperature, precipitation, and seasonality ranges) of Patagonian peatlands on the basis of modern peatland distribution and gridded climate data to discuss climate controls of Patagonian peatlands at the present and in the past by inference. Results indicated that Patagonian peatlands occupy a distinct climatological niche that corresponds to an end-member of the northern peatland climate domain, with a mild mean annual temperature (from 3 to 9 °C) and very weak temperature seasonality. We also found that Patagonian peatlands have been efficient land carbon sinks since their initiation, with a mean soil carbon density of 168 kg C m-2 ± 10%. The total carbon pool for these ecosystems was estimated at 7.6 GtC. Modeled peat addition rates to the catotelm in Patagonian peatlands were significantly higher than what has been reported for northern peatlands, but decay coefficients were similar between these two high-latitude regions. These results support the idea that long, mild growing seasons promote peat formation in southern Patagonia. At the regional scale however, the lack of correlation between climatic parameters and peat accumulation indices suggests that autogenic controlling factors might be at play. Overall, southern peatlands provide a unique opportunity for studying peatland-carbon-climate linkages under a new set of climatic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Gebhardt2010,
abstract = {The drainage of a riparian peatland interspersed with organic and mineral substrates in Northern Germany has led to subsidence morphology due to mineralisation, initial settlement and shrinkage processes causing cultivation problems and yield declines. To explain the relevancy of shrinkage to changes of the surface morphology and soil properties, organic and mineral substrates were analysed with regard to (1) shrinkage potential (i.e. the maximum shrinkage), (2) shrinkage curve, (3) actual in situ shrinkage and (4) irreversible shrinkage proportions. The investigated substrates are sedge peat, peat-clay, half-bog and alluvial sand of Fibric Limnic Histosols (Drainic) and a glacial clay for comparison. The methods used to obtain the shrinkage curves include the consideration of crack formation due to desiccation, as digital photography and image analysis were used in addition to height change measurements. To characterise the actual in situ shrinkage, continuous records of the soil matric potential for a 4.5-year period at two different intensively drained Histosols (moderately and deeply drained: mean groundwater table 0.6 and 1.7 m under ground level) were accomplished in four depths (15, 40, 70, 100 cm). The measured shrinkage potentials vary between 2% (alluvial sand) and 65% (peat-clay). The sedge peat and peat-clay are characterised by distinct higher shrinkage potentials compared to the glacial clay and show distinct proportional shrinkage. It has to be pointed out that the soil volume loss partly even exceeds the loss in water volume. The sedge peat does not reach residual or zero shrinkage but shows distinct structural shrinkage at initial desiccation. For the moderately drained site, matric potentials reached up to -60 kPa in summer in 15-cm depth, whilst capillary rise almost prevented desiccation of deeper zones. For the deeply drained site, summer desiccation reached deeper zones as well (matric potential up to -50 kPa in 40-cm depth) due to absent capillary rise. In the range of actually occurring maximum desiccation, the half-bog and peat-clay with high decomposed organic matter are particularly affected by shrinkage with volume decreases of 10-14%, in contrast to the fibred sedge peat with only 4%. When uniquely shrunken substrates will be re-wetted, distinct irreversible shrinkage proportions reaching between 18% and 31% subsequent to drying to a matric potential of -50 kPa and re-saturation were measured. Particularly, the organic-rich substrates appeared as characteristically sensitive to soil shrinkage. Contrary to mineral substrates, they lack in solid particles, leading, along with high hydraulic stresses due to dominantly finer pores, to intense volume decreases after desiccation. These substrates therefore partly also lack in residual or zero shrinkage, and the soil volume loss can even exceed the water loss due to shrinkage. Accordingly, the alterations of soil properties, e.g. conductivities, are especially pronounced. The calculated proportion of actual in situ shrinkage (0.5 to 1 dm) to total subsidence of the investigated peatland is rather low for the deeply drained site in comparison to initial settlement (2-3 dm) and long-term active mineralisation (e.g. 4 dm in 40 years, mineralisation rate 1 cm year(-1)) but accelerates the latter because of enhanced aeration due to crack formation. Irreversible shrinkage is one reason why re-wetted fen peats do not retrieve their initial volume as well as their initial physical and hydraulic properties. Thus, a re-wetting of drained fen peats can only preserve the present condition. To impede the further impairment of riparian peatlands, it is necessary to maintain a near-surface water table particularly throughout the summer months, when high desiccation occurs, leading to a spatially differentiated proportion of initial settlement, shrinkage and mineralisation, causing subsidence morphology. Our recommendation is a drainage depth of less than 60 cm to enable pasture or grassland land use and to minimise mineralisation as well as structure formation in the (sub)soil.},

abstract = {Sustaining forest resources requires a better understanding of forest ecosystem processes, and how management decisions and climate change may affect these processes in the future. While plot and inventory data provide our most detailed information on forest carbon, energy, and water cycling, applying this understanding to broader spatial and temporal domains requires scaling approaches. Remote sensing provides a powerful resource for “upscaling” process understanding to regional and continental domains. The increased range of available remote sensing modalities, including interferometric radar, lidar, and hyperspectral imagery, allows the retrieval of a broad range of forest attributes. This paper reviews the application of remote sensing for upscaling forest attributes from the plot scale to regional domains, with particular emphasis on how remote sensing products can support parameterization and validation of ecosystem process models. We focus on four key ecological attributes of forests: composition, structure, productivity and evapotranspiration, and disturbance dynamics. For each attribute, we discuss relevant remote sensing technologies, provide examples of their application, and critically evaluate both strengths and challenges associated with their use.},

abstract = {Abstract:G{\c{C}}{\'{e}}The potential for conservation of individual species has been greatly advanced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) development of objective, repeatable, and transparent criteria for assessing extinction risk that explicitly separate risk assessment from priority setting. At the IV World Conservation Congress in 2008, the process began to develop and implement comparable global standards for ecosystems. A working group established by the IUCN has begun formulating a system of quantitative categories and criteria, analogous to those used for species, for assigning levels of threat to ecosystems at local, regional, and global levels. A final system will require definitions of ecosystems; quantification of ecosystem status; identification of the stages of degradation and loss of ecosystems; proxy measures of risk (criteria); classification thresholds for these criteria; and standardized methods for performing assessments. The system will need to reflect the degree and rate of change in an ecosystem's extent, composition, structure, and function, and have its conceptual roots in ecological theory and empirical research. On the basis of these requirements and the hypothesis that ecosystem risk is a function of the risk of its component species, we propose a set of four criteria: recent declines in distribution or ecological function, historical total loss in distribution or ecological function, small distribution combined with decline, or very small distribution. Most work has focused on terrestrial ecosystems, but comparable thresholds and criteria for freshwater and marine ecosystems are also needed. These are the first steps in an international consultation process that will lead to a unified proposal to be presented at the next World Conservation Congress in 2012Resumen:G{\c{C}}{\'{e}}El potencial para la conservaci+¦n de muchas especies ha avanzado enormemente porque la Uni+¦n Internacional para la Conservaci+¦n de la Naturaleza (UICN) ha desarrollado criterios objetivos, repetibles y transparentes para evaluar el riesgo de extinci+¦n que expl+¡citamente separa la evaluaci+¦n de riesgo de la definici+¦n de prioridades.

abstract = {Remote sensing needs to clarify the strengths of different methods so they can be consistently applied in forest management and ecology. Both the use of phenological information in satellite imagery and the use of vegetation indices have independently improved classifications of north temperate forests. Combining these sources of information in change detection has been effective for land cover classifications at the continental scale based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Our objective is to test if using vegetation indices and change analysis of multiseasonal imagery can also improve the classification accuracy of deciduous forests at the landscape scale. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes that corresponded to Populus spp. leaf-on and Quercus spp. leaf-off (May), peak summer (August), Acer spp. peak color (September), Acer spp. and Populus spp. leaf-off (October). Input data files derived from the imagery were: (1) TM Bands 3, 4, and 5 from all dates; (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from all dates; (3) Tasseled Cap brightness, greenness, and wetness (BGW) from all dates; (4) difference in TM Bands 3, 4, and 5 from one date to the next; (5) difference in NDVI from one date to the next; and (6) difference in BGW from one date to the next. The overall kappa statistics (KHAT) for the aforementioned classifications of deciduous genera were 0.48, 0.36, 0.33, 0.38, 0.26, 0.43, respectively. The highest accuracies occurred from TM Bands 3, 4, and 5 (61.0% for deciduous genera, 67.8% for all classes) or from the difference in BGW (61.0% for deciduous genera, 67.8% for all classes). However, the difference in Tasseled Cap classification more accurately separated deciduous shrubs and harvested stands from closed canopy forest. Our results indicate that phenological change of forest is most accurately captured by combining image differencing and Tasseled Cap indices. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. A review is presented of the literature on riparian vegetated buffer strips (VBS) for use in stream-water-quality restoration and limitations associated with their use are discussed. The results are also presented of recent investigations on the effectiveness of a forested and a grass vegetated buffer strip for reducing shallow subsurface inputs of nutrients from agriculture to a stream in central Illinois, U.S.A. 2. Because riparian zones link the stream with its terrestrial catchment, they can modify, incorporate, dilute, or concentrate substances before they enter a lotic system. In small to mid-size streams forested riparian zones can moderate temperatures, reduce sediment inputs, provide important sources of organic matter, and stabilize stream banks. 3. Several questions on the utility and efficiency of vegetated buffer strips for stream restoration still remain unanswered, including: what types (grass v forest) are most efficient; do they become nutrient saturated; are they only temporary sinks; how does species composition influence effectiveness; and, what is the optimal width of buffer to facilitate nutrient reduction under different conditions? 4. Water samples were collected (1989–90) from lysimeters located at three depths (60, 120, and > 120cm) in an upland area planted in conventional row crops (corn and soybean) and in three adjacent riparian buffer treatments, a 39m wide grass buffer. a 16 m wide mature forested buffer, and a buffer planted in row-crops to the stream bank. Concentrations of dissolved and total phosphorus and nitrate-N in each sample were determined following major precipitation events over a seventeen month period. 5. Both the forested and grass VBS reduced nitrate-N concentrations in shallow groundwater (up to 90% reduction). On an annual basis the forested VBS was more effective at reducing concentrations of nitrate-N than was the grass VBS, but was less efficient at retaining total and dissolved P. 6. During the dormant season, both grass and forested buffer strips released dissolved and total P to the groundwater. The VBS apparently acted as a nutrient sink for much of the year, but also released accumulated nutrients during the remaining portion of the year. Periodic harvesting of plant biomass may reduce the amount of P released during the dormant season. 7. VBSs are not as effective in agriculture areas with tile drained fields. Alternative restoration practices such as discharging drain tiles into wetlands constructed parallel to the stream channel may prove to be a more effective means of controlling non-point-source agricultural inputs of nutrients in such areas.},

However, it is not always easy to obtain it because OD surveys are expensive and difficult to implement. This is particularly relevant in large cities with congested networks, where detailed zonification and time disaggregation require large sample sizes and complicated survey methods. Therefore, the incorporation of information technology in some public transport systems around the world is an excellent opportunity for passive data collection. In this paper, we present a methodology for estimating a public transport OD matrix from smartcard and GPS data for Santiago, Chile. The proposed method is applied to two 1-week datasets obtained for different time periods. From the data available, we obtain detailed information about the time and position of boarding public transportation and generate an estimation of time and position of alighting for over 80% of the boarding transactions. The results are available at any desired time-space disaggregation. After some post-processing and after incorporating expansion factors to account for unobserved trips, we build public transport OD matrices. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984???2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond.},

abstract = {Multispectral imagery (MSI) provides information to support decision making across a growing number of private and industrial applications. Among them, land mapping, terrain classification and feature extraction rank highly in the interest of those who analyze the data to produce information, reports, and intelligence products. The 8 nominal band centers of WorldView-2 allow us to use non-traditional means of measuring the differences which exist in the features, artifacts, and surface materials in the data, and we can determine the most effective method for processing this information by exploiting the unique response values within those wavelength channels. The difference in responses across select bands can be sought using normalized difference index ratios to measure moisture content, indicate vegetation health, and distinguish natural features from man-made objects. The focus of this effort is to develop an approach to measure, identify and threshold these differences in order to establish an effective land mapping and feature extraction process germane to WorldView-2 imagery.},

abstract = {Optical images of different spectral and spatial resolutions continue to provide a reliable source of data for estimating forest inventory parameters. WorldView-2 launched in October 2009 is the first commercial optical satellite to provide high spatial resolution images with eight spectral bands, some of which are new and require investigation for estimation of forest structure parameters. In this study, a WorldView-2 multispectral image has been investigated for mapping pine plantation structural parameters including stand volume, basal area, stocking, mean diameter at breast height (mean DBH), and mean height of trees over a Pinus radiata plantation in New South Wales, Australia. Spectral derivatives including reflectance bands, band ratios, principal components (PCs), and several vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated using four typical bands, including blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR1), and all eight bands. Moreover, textural information, including 11 grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) indices, was extracted using four window sizes and orientations. Several models were developed using the extracted attributes separately to compare the efficiency of the models derived from the attributes of four typical bands and eight bands, as well as to compare between the capability of spectral-based and textural-based models for estimating structural parameters. The results showed that models derived from textural attributes of eight spectral bands provide the best estimates compared to those derived from four typical bands and the models derived from spectral derivatives. Moreover, the mean height and mean DBH with 8% and 13.7% error of estimation, respectively, were estimated more accurately than basal area, stand volume, and stocking, where the error of estimation is up to 30%.},

abstract = {In an effort to increase conservation effectiveness through the use of Earth observation technologies, a group of remote sensing scientists affiliated with government and academic institutions and conservation organizations identified 10 questions in conservation for which the potential to be answered would be greatly increased by use of remotely sensed data and analyses of those data. Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?

Labour market areas (LMAs) are argued to represent a more appropriate policy framework than administrative units for the analysis of spatial labour market activity. This article develops LMAs for Chile by applying an evolutionary computation approach. This innovative approach defines LMAs through an optimization process by maximization of internal cohesion, subject to restrictions of minimum levels of self-containment and population. To evaluate the appropriateness of the LMAs, comparative analyses are performed between alternative delimitations based on different parameter configurations of the proposed method versus administrative boundaries and the most widely used method for official LMA delimitation, the travel-to-work areas method.},

abstract = {One of the surprising recurring phenomena observed in experiments with boosting is that the test error of the generated classifier usually does not increase as its size becomes very large, and often is observed to decrease even after the training error reaches zero. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance decomposition.},

abstract = {The recent rise in global demand for natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) has led to expansive areas of natural forest being transformed into monoculture plantations. This paper explores the utility of annual Landsat time series for monitoring forest disturbance and the role of natural rubber in mainland Southeast Asia from 2000 to 2012. A region on the Cambodian-Vietnamese border was chosen for this study considering four primary questions: 1) how accurately can annual Landsat time series map the location and timing of forest disturbances in evergreen and seasonal tropical forests, 2) are there cross-border differences in frontier and non-frontier forest disturbance rates between Cambodia and Vietnam, 3) what proportion of disturbances in frontier and non-frontier forests can be accounted for by the impact of rubber plantations, and 4) is there a relationship between global market prices for natural rubber and the annual rate of frontier forest clearing for rubber plantations on both sides of the border. We used LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) for temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series and disturbance mapping. Our results show that this approach can provide accurate forest disturbance maps but that accuracy is affected by forest type. Highest accuracies were found in evergreen forest (91%), with lower accuracies in mixed (82%) and dry-deciduous forest types (86%). Our final map considering all forest types yielded an overall accuracy of 86%. Forest disturbance rates were generally higher on the Cambodian side of the border. Frontier forest disturbance rates averaged 3.8%/year in Cambodia compared to 2.5%/year in Vietnam. Conversion to rubber was the dominant form of frontier forest change in both countries (42% in Cambodia and 84% in Vietnam). Non-frontier forest disturbances averaged 4.0% and 2.5% in Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively, with most disturbances likewise linked with rubber plantations. Although rates of frontier forest disturbance differed in both countries, they each displayed similar correlations between disturbance rates related to rubber plantation expansion and price fluctuations of natural rubber. This suggests links between localized land cover/use change and international market forces, irrespective of differing political and socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study underlines the value of using dense Landsat time series when exploring the dynamics of human-induced land cover change.},

abstract = {Despite research on urban heat island (UHI) effect has increased exponentially over the last few decades, a systematic review of factors contributing to UHI effect has scarcely been reported in the literature. This paper provides a systematic and overarching review of different spatial and temporal factors affecting the UHI effect. UHI is a phenomenon when urban areas experience a higher temperature than their surrounding non-urban areas and is considered as a critical factor contributing to global warming, heat related mortalities, and unpredictable climatic changes. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify the spatio-temporal factors that contribute to (or mitigate) the UHI effect in order to develop a thorough understanding of their causal mechanism so that these are addressed through urban planning policies. This paper systematically identified 75 eligible studies on UHI effect and reviews the nature and type of satellite images used, the techniques applied to classify land cover/use changes, the models to assess the link between spatio-temporal factors and UHI effect, and the effects of these factors on UHI. The review results show that: a) 54% of the studies used Landsat TM images for modelling the UHI effect followed by Landsat ETM (34%), and MODIS (28%); b) land cover indices (46%), followed by supervised classification (17%) were the dominant methods to derive land cover/use changes associated with UHI effect; c) ordinary least square regression is the most commonly applied method (68%) to investigate the link between different spatio-temporal factors and the UHI effect followed by comparative analysis (33%); and d) the most common factors affecting the UHI effect as reported in the reviewed studies, include vegetation cover (44%), season (33%), built-up area (28%), day/night (25%), population density (14%), water body (12%) together with others. This research discusses the findings in policy terms and provides directions for future research.},

@book{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {A substantial body of literature has accumulated on the topic of the estimation of species richness by extrapolation. However, most of these methods rely on an objective sampling of nature. This condition is difficult to meet and seldom achieved for large regions. Furthermore, scientists conducting biological surveys often already have preliminary but subjectively gathered species lists, and would like to assess the completeness of such lists, and/or to find a way to perfect them. We propose several strategies for utilizing external data (such as might be obtained using GIS) to aid in the completion of species lists. These include: (i) using existing species lists to develop predictive models; (ii) using the uniqueness of the environment as a guide to find underrepresented species; (iii) using spectral heterogeneity to locate environmentally heterogeneous regions; (iv) combining surveys with statistical model-building in an iterative manner. We demonstrate the potential of these approaches using simulation and case studies from Oklahoma.},

Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

@article{Mijnsbrugge2010,
abstract = {Native plant species are routinely planted or sown in ecological restoration projects, but successful establishment and survival depend on where and how seeds are collected. Research suggests that it is important to use locally adapted seeds. Local populations often show a home-site advantage and non-local genotypes may be maladapted to local environmental conditions. Furthermore, intraspecific hybridisation of local and non-local genotypes may have a negative impact on the genetic structure of local populations via mechanisms such as outbreeding depression. Many species show a strong small-scale genetic differentiation between different habitats so that matching habitats of the restoration and donor site can be more important than minimizing geographical separation. It is a challenge to identify appropriate seed sources because strong small-scale population differentiation makes it difficult to delineate geographically defined seed zones to which seed exchange should be limited. Moreover, it is important to consider the genetic diversity of introduced material because it may be crucial to avoid genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding depression and poor establishment of plant populations. Repeated propagation in stock, which is often required to obtain a sufficient amount of seeds, can further reduce genetic diversity and may select for particular genotypes. Negative impacts of improper seed choice for nursery planting stock may become detectable only after many years, especially in long-lived and slow growing plants. Although scientific information on many species remains limited, the increasing demand for translocation of seed means that mandatory regulations are necessary. Guidelines should prescribe a specification of seed provenance, a record of genetic diversity of wild collections and rules for subsequent processing such as direct transfer and propagation of stock or seed orchards. We use a literature review to evaluate current legislation and to develop recommendations for herbaceous and woody species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

@article{Goodenough2012,
abstract = {Despite recent papers on problems associated with full-model and stepwise regression, their use is still common throughout ecological and environmental disciplines. Alternative approaches, including generating multiple models and comparing them post-hoc using techniques such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), are becoming more popular. However, these are problematic when there are numerous independent variables and interpretation is often difficult when competing models contain many different variables and combinations of variables. Here, we detail a new approach, REVS (Regression with Empirical Variable Selection), which uses all-subsets regression to quantify empirical support for every independent variable. A series of models is created; the first containing the variable with most empirical support, the second containing the first variable and the next most-supported, and so on. The comparatively small number of resultant models (n = the number of predictor variables) means that post-hoc comparison is comparatively quick and easy. When tested on a real dataset--habitat and offspring quality in the great tit (Parus major)--the optimal REVS model explained more variance (higher R(2)), was more parsimonious (lower AIC), and had greater significance (lower P values), than full, stepwise or all-subsets models; it also had higher predictive accuracy based on split-sample validation. Testing REVS on ten further datasets suggested that this is typical, with R(2) values being higher than full or stepwise models (mean improvement = 31% and 7%, respectively). Results are ecologically intuitive as even when there are several competing models, they share a set of "core" variables and differ only in presence/absence of one or two additional variables. We conclude that REVS is useful for analysing complex datasets, including those in ecology and environmental disciplines.},

abstract = {<p>Topographical information is fundamental to many geo-spatial related information and applications on Earth. Remote sensing satellites have the advantage in such fields because they are capable of global observation and repeatedly. Several satellite-based digital elevation datasets were provided to examine global terrains with medium resolutions e.g. the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the global digital elevation model by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER GDEM). A new global digital surface model (DSM) dataset using the archived data of the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS, nicknamed “Daichi”) has been completed on March 2016 by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) collaborating with NTT DATA Corp. and Remote Sensing Technology Center, Japan. This project is called “ALOS World 3D” (AW3D), and its dataset consists of the global DSM dataset with 0.15 arcsec. pixel spacing (approx. 5&thinsp;m mesh) and ortho-rectified PRISM image with 2.5&thinsp;m resolution. JAXA is also processing the global DSM with 1&thinsp;arcsec. spacing (approx. 30&thinsp;m mesh) based on the AW3D DSM dataset, and partially releasing it free of charge, which calls “ALOS World 3D 30&thinsp;m mesh” (AW3D30). The global AW3D30 dataset will be released on May 2016. This paper describes the processing status, a preliminary validation result of the AW3D30 DSM dataset, and its public release status. As a summary of the preliminary validation of AW3D30 DSM, 4.40&thinsp;m (RMSE) of the height accuracy of the dataset was confirmed using 5,121 independent check points distributed in the world.</p>},

abstract = {A new method called Fmask (Function of mask) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery is provided. Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Brightness Temperature (BT) are used as inputs. Fmask first uses rules based on cloud physical properties to separate Potential Cloud Pixels (PCPs) and clear-sky pixels. Next, a normalized temperature probability, spectral variability probability, and brightness probability are combined to produce a probability mask for clouds over land and water separately. Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4%. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Fare evasion is a problem in many public transport systems around the world and policies to reduce it are generally aimed at improving control and increasing fines. We use an econometric approach to attempt explaining the high levels of evasion in Santiago, Chile, and guide public policy formulation to reduce this problem. In particular, a negative binomial count regression model allowed us to find that fare evasion rates on buses increase as: (i) more people board (or alight) at a given bus door, (ii) more passengers board by a rear door, (iii) buses have higher occupancy levels (and more doors) and (iv) passengers experience longer headways. By controlling these variables (ceteris paribus), results indicate that evasion is greater during the afternoon and evening, but it is not clear that it is higher during peak hours. Regarding socioeconomic variables, we found that fare evasion at bus stops located in higher income areas (municipalities) is significantly lower than in more deprived areas. Finally, based on our results we identified five main methods to address evasion as alternatives to more dedicated fine enforcement or increased inspection; (i) increasing the bus fleet, (ii) improving the bus headway regularity, (iii) implementing off-board payment stations, (iv) changing the payment system on board and (v) changing the bus design (number of doors or capacity). Our model provides a powerful tool to predict the reduction of fare evasion due to the implementation of some of these five operational strategies, and can be applied to other bus public transport systems.},

However, the resolution of ASTER stereo images (15 m) is much coarser than areal stereo images, and the ASTER GDEM is compiled products from stereo images acquired over 10 years. The forest disturbances as well as forest growth are inevitable in 10 years time span. In this study, the features of ASTER GDEM over vegetated areas under both flat and mountainous conditions were investigated by comparisons with lidar data.

The mining industry is the main contractor of such workers and the impact of the process spreads through the rest of the Chilean territory.Using an input-output approach, this paper shows that a significant amount of resources generated by the mining industries in the Region of Antofagasta goes to other regions in wages earned by commuters who have decided to work in this region but live in another. The commuting process seems to be driven by centripetal forces that support centralization, thus arguing for regional policies to promote the attractiveness of the peripheral regions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a R-package for the stratification of a survey population using a univariate stratification variable X and for the calculation of stratum sample sizes. Non iterative methods such as the cumulative root frequency method and the geometric stratum boundaries are implemented. Optimal designs, with stratum boundaries that minimize either the CV of the simple expansion estimator for a fixed sample size n or the n value for a fixed CV can be constructed. Two iterative algorithms are available to find the optimal stratum boundaries. The design can feature a user defined certainty stratum where all the units are sampled. Take-all and take-none strata can be included in the stratified design as they might lead to smaller sample sizes. The sample size calculations are based on the anticipated moments of the survey variable Y, given the stratification variable X. The package handles conditional distributions of Y given X that are either a heteroscedastic linear model, or a log-linear model. Stratum specific non-response can be accounted for in the design construction and in the sample size calculations. Key},

Our analyses, to date, have found gaps of varying magnitude in U.S. holdings of Landsat global coverage data, which appear to reflect technical or administrative variations in mission operations. In many cases it may be possible to partially fill these gaps in U.S. holdings through observations that were acquired and are now being held at International Cooperator stations.},

abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

                        density, g nitrogen m
                        -2 soil). A number of grouped wavebands with high correlation (R
                        2>95%) were revealed. For the crop variables based on quantity per unit surface area, i.e. GBM, LAI, Chl
                        density, and N
                        density, these wavebands had in the majority (87%) of the cases a center wavelength in the red edge spectral region from 680 to 750 nm and the band combinations were often paired so that both bands were closely spaced in the steep linear shift between R 
                        red and R
                        nir. The red edge region was almost absent for bands related to Chl
                        conc and N
                        conc, where the visible spectral range, mainly in the blue region, proved to be better. The selected narrow-band indices improved the description of the influence of all six-crop variables compared to the traditional broad- and short-band indices normally applied on data from satellite, aerial photos, and field spectroradiometers. For variables expressed on the basis of soil or canopy surface area, the relationship was further improved when exponential curve fitting was used instead of linear regression. The best of the selected narrow-band indices was compared to the results of a partial least square regression (PLS). This comparison showed that the narrow-band indices related to LAI and Chl 
                        conc, and to some extent also Chl
                        density and N 
                        density, were optimal and could not be significantly improved by PLS using the information from all wavelengths in the hyperspectral region. However, PLS improved the prediction of GBM and N
                        conc by lowering the RMSE with 22% and 24%, respectively, compared to the best narrow-band indices. It is concluded that PLS regression analysis may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool when applied on hyperspectral reflectance data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Remote sensing offers the potential to spatially map forest cover quickly and reliably for inventory purposes. We developed a new image analysis approach using an integrated methodology of "object-based" image classification techniques and field-based measurements to quantify forest cover in a degraded dry forest ecosystem on the leeward side of the Island of Hawaii. This new approach explicitly recognized the transitional areas between tree crowns and tree shades (tree shadows) as a unique class and fully utilized them for the quantification of canopy cover. Object-oriented classification of Ikonos-2 satellite images allowed delineation of tree shades and crowns and the transitional areas between them from objects with similar reflectance and size that were surrounding the trees. These included patches of fountain (Pennisetum setaceum) and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) grass, lava outcrops and lava-grass mixtures. Crown-shade transitions were clearly differentiated in spite of their wide range of spectral values and reflectance similarities with areas of lava-grass mixture. Segments representing tree shades and dark lava outcrops were also classified into their respective classes even if they were contiguous. The image estimates of canopy cover using the tree shade plus transition classes were linearly related with field estimates of canopy cover (R\n                        2 = 0.86 and slope = 0.976). Based on this relationship, dry forest cover throughout the 2627-ha area was estimated at 7.7 ?? 1.9%. An immediate application of this new approach is to select and delineate areas with higher canopy cover in order to concentrate ecological restoration and conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Tropical dry forests provide globally important ecosystem services and host exceptionally high biodiversity. These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming. We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5–8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994–1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailed information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics. We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing.},

abstract = {The OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor on Landsat-8 has the potential to meet the requirements of remote sensing of water color. However, the optical properties of inland waters are more complex than those of oceanic waters, and inland atmospheric correction presents additional challenges. We examined the performance of atmospheric correction (AC) methods for remote sensing over three highly turbid or hypereutrophic inland waters in China: Lake Hongze, Lake Chaohu, and Lake Taihu. Four water-AC algorithms (SWIR (Short Wave Infrared), EXP (Exponential Extrapolation), DSF (Dark Spectrum Fitting), and MUMM (Management Unit Mathematics Models)) and three land-AC algorithms (FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes), 6SV (a version of Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), and QUAC (Quick Atmospheric Correction)) were assessed using Landsat-8 OLI data and concurrent in situ data. The results showed that the EXP (and DSF) together with 6SV algorithms provided the best estimates of the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and band ratios in water-AC algorithms and land-AC algorithms, respectively. AC algorithms showed a discriminating accuracy for different water types (turbid waters, in-water algae waters, and floating bloom waters). For turbid waters, EXP gave the best Rrs in visible bands. For the in-water algae and floating bloom waters, however, all water-algorithms failed due to an inappropriate aerosol model and non-zero reflectance at 1609 nm. The results of the study show the improvements that can be achieved considering SWIR bands and using band ratios, and the need for further development of AC algorithms for complex aquatic and atmospheric conditions, typical of inland waters.},

abstract = {An inaccurate map is not a reliable map. "X" may mark the spot where the treasure is buried, but unless the seeker can locate "X" in relation to known landmarks, the map is not very useful. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) publishes maps and other products at high levels of accuracy. Dependability is vital, for example, to engineers, highway officials, and land-use planners who use USGS topographic maps as basic planning tools. As a result, the USGS makes every effort to achieve a high level of accuracy in all of its published products. An important aim of its accuracy control program is to meet the U.S. National Map Accuracy Standards. National Map Accuracy Standards To find methods of ensuring the accuracy of both location (the latitude and longitude of a point) and elevation (the altitude above sea level), the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing -an organization actively involved in the science of making precise measurements from photographs (photogrammetry) and acquiring information from aerial photographs and satellite image data (remote sensing) -set up a committee in 1937 to draft accuracy specifications. Sparked by this work, agencies of the Federal Government, including the USGS, began their own inquiries and studies of map accuracy standards. In 1941, the U.S. Bureau of the Budget issued the "United States National Map Accuracy Standards," which applied to all Federal agencies that produce maps. The standards were revised several times, and the current version was issued in 1947. (The standards are printed at the end of this factsheet.) As applied to the USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle topographic map, the horizontal accuracy standard requires that the positions of 90 percent of all points tested must be accurate within 1/50th of an inch (0.05 centimeters) on the map. At 1:24,000 scale, 1/50th of an inch is 40 feet (12.2 meters). The vertical accuracy standard requires that the elevation of 90 percent of all points tested must be correct within half of the contour interval. On a map with a contour interval of 10 feet, the map must correctly show 90 percent of all points tested within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the actual elevation. All maps produced by the USGS at 1:250,000 scale and larger are prepared by methods designed to meet these accuracy standards and carry the statement, "This map complies with National Map},

Selection of an accumulation threshold (AT) for stream extraction and delineation of URCs are often done manually. Two algorithms are introduced in this paper that allow for automated AT selection and URC delineation. ATs are selected to yield the highest overlap of DEM-derived and traditionally mapped streams as well as to assure extraction of all mapped streams from DEMs. URCs are delineated after snapping SSPs to DEM-derived streams. The new tool showed similar or better performance than comparable algorithms and is freely available, interfacing the open source software packages R and GRASS GIS. It will improve the extraction of stream networks and the assessment of magnitude and scale of effects from riparian stressors (e.g. landuse) on freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {A new procedure for the representation of flow directions and calculation of upslope areas using rectangular grid digital elevation models is presented. The procedure is based on representing flow direction as a single angle taken as the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets centered at each grid point. Upslope area is then calculated by proportioning flow between two downslope pixels according to how close this flow direction is to the direct angle to the downslope pixel. This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bias) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion). The new procedure is more robust than prior procedures based on fitting local planes while retaining a simple grid based structure. Detailed algorithms are presented and results are demonstrated through test examples and application to digital elevation data sets.},

abstract = {Lack of data often limits understanding and management of biodiversity in forested areas. Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DVI, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R
                        2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2, ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R
                        2 = 0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran. Crown Copyright ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Covering 40% of the terrestrial surface, dryland ecosystems characteristically have distinct vegetation structures that are strongly linked to their function. Existing survey approaches cannot provide sufficiently fine-resolution data at landscape-level extents to quantify this structure appropriately. Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grass-to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine (<1 cm2) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10 ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm3in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r2from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.},

This objective is accomplished by comparing the same scalar dimensions of two different problems: the first one is adaptation to climate change policies in Mexico, and the second is deforestation. This paper presents the main elements that have been discussed in recent years in the Anglo literature on the concept of scale, particularly the extent, resolution, level, hierarchy, the problem of modifiable area unit and spatial fallacies. The properties of geographical concepts emerge and can be observed according to the combination of scalar elements. The most fundamental scalar principles discussed in the field refer to identify the combination of elements in which it is possible to observe each geographical phenomena's variability, characteristics and properties. One of the most relevant problems of the scalar thinking refers to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), which stems from the data aggregation; the relevant values represented for each spatial unit relate to each other in different ways according to how they organized within a hierarchical structure. Data aggregation affects how the variability and heterogeneity of a phenomenon can be observed, given that the change of scale may show or hide specific properties of the dataset in a change of resolution. This problem is relevant for the inferences that stem from the data, given that individualistic or ecological fallacies may emerge if the dataset characteristics are not correctly interpreted in terms of representation, similarity or heterogeneity. Applying these principles to the comparison between two different geographical problems of different epistemological nature, we show the importance of this concept for the geographical thought; the comparison highlights the need to generate systematic reflections in this regard for the Geography produced in Spanish language. Regarding the socio-environmental problems addressed, the climate change adaptation policies in Mexico show a lack of conceptual and programmatic integration in different levels; the lack of an adequate concurrent relationship between them creates a problem to generate effective results for adaptation. We identify three policy levels (global, national and local), in which we briefly examine the relevant policy instrument and actor(s) that negotiate, design and/ or implement it in each level. For the international level we briefly present the role of the Mexican government on the negotiation and adoption of the Kyoto Protocol principles and goals; for the national level, we examine the approach and jurisdiction of the Special Program of Climate Change and the related juridical field; for the local level, we discuss the Municipal Climate Action Programmes, their design and scope, as well as the lack density that has prevented these instrument to influence other policy levels. This section discusses the hierarchies between these levels, the extension (jurisdiction) under which each of them are relevant and the importance of each scalar level for visualizing the main characteristics of the different adaptation policies. Regarding deforestation and land use change, the scale analysis reveals that might be direct (proximate) and indirect (underlying) and operate on multiple levels; also, its consequences are manifested in different scales of space and time. The spatial heterogeneity of land use change reveals the combination of biophysical and social, economic and political conditions, so the deforestation rate and causes change with observation scale. The implication of scale is that important land use processes could remain undetected, thus not monitored by traditional tools and aggregated land use categories typically applied. On the other hand, the choice of the time scale could undetect economic or social processes that change from year to year, which obscure the underlying causes of deforestation. It is therefore necessary to see change in land use with a view hierarchies.},

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of "good practice" recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the "reference classification" will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus(genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

abstract = {We explore the issues relevant to those types of ecosystems containing new combinations of species that arise through human action, environmental change, and the impacts of the deliberate and inadvertent introduction of species from other regions. Novel ecosystems (also termed 'emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or 'wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

@article{Nichol2013,
abstract = {There is no research which specifically investigates the influence of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) on topographic correction of satellite images. Such an investigation is necessary in view of the very high resolution (VHR) of recent sensors such as Ikonos and QuickBird and the low availability of accurate height information for the derivation of slope and aspect values. A comparative study. of multispectral Ikonos images is presented using eight selected interpolation techniques with contour data. The DEM influence was evaluated by analyzing the variance and classification accuracy of topographically corrected images using the different DEMS. These were found to vary widely, with a 30 percent reduction in variance and a 20 percent improvement in overall classification accuracy between the worst and best performing interpolation techniques. Furthermore, smoothing techniques commonly used for the removal of noise in interpolated contour data or in existing DEMs were found to offer no significant improvement in intra-class variance or classification accuracy, when used with a grid resolution compatible with VHR images. However, a more rigorous planar slope function was found to be more effective, and when combined with the best interpolator, the natural neighbor, or Sibson, method, very high classification accuracy was achieved in the topographically corrected images.},

Thoroughly revised and reorganised, this new edition of this prize-winning textbook begins with underlying causal factors, before moving on to more advanced concepts that add depth and context. Each chapter begins with an explanation of the basic principles covered, illustrated with clear examples. More difficult concepts and exceptions are introduced only once the general principle is well-established. Key principles are now discussed at the beginning of the book, and in order of relative importance, enabling students to understand the most important material without wading through complex theory.

@article{Congalton2003,
abstract = {Riparian vegetation provides many important functions for fish and wildlife habitat, yet we lack the information about riparian condition needed for planning and policy decisions. In this project, we developed a more cost-effective method to classify riparian vegetation using aerial photography and compared the results with maps generated from classifying Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. We used ortho-photography and other data freely available from the public domain, plus Arclnfo's capability to display stream buffers on top of photos, to identify the vegetation structure and location. Two buffers, one from 0 to 15.25 m and the other from 15.25 to 61 m on each side of the streams, were segmented rather than using the traditional method of drawing polygons around the vegetation types. This method was faster and cheaper than digitizing vegetation polygons, plus it allowed the photo interpreter's judgment to correct for stream location errors in the data without having to redraw the stream's location. Riparian vegetation structure was found to be far different from upland forest stands in the watershed. Hardwoods dominated the riparian zones. Overall, hardwood stands made up 59% of the vegetation within the first 15.25 m from the stream in a watershed where 75% of the upland area was conifer stands. Agricultural zones were dominated by hardwood stands and open conditions. Only 1-2% of the areas within 15.25 m of the streams had large conifer stands, while over 80% of these areas were hardwoods or brush. The 'open area' class comprised 13% of the total area within the first 15.25 m of the streams and increased to 49% in the area between 15.25 and 61 m from the streams. Current forest classifications based on Landsat TM imagery did not do a good job of identifying the structural characteristics of riparian vegetation. Our Landsat TM and photo classifications only agreed 25-30% of the time. The extreme diversity and linear arrangement of the riparian vegetation creates classification problems and results in the Landsat TM imagery being inadequate for use in policy decisions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {<p>For reasons of documentation, management and certification there is a high interest in efficient inventories of palm plantations on the single plant level. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology facilitate spatial and temporal flexible acquisition of high resolution 3D data. Common single tree detection approaches are based on Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite or Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data. However, VHR data is often limited to clouds and does commonly not allow for height measurements. VHR and in particualar ALS data are characterized by high relatively high acquisition costs. Sperlich et al. (2013) already demonstrated the high potential of UAV-based photogrammetric point clouds for single tree detection using pouring algorithms. This approach was adjusted and improved for an application on palm plantation. The 9.4ha test site on Tarawa, Kiribati, comprised densely scattered growing palms, as well as abundant undergrowth and trees. Using a standard consumer grade camera mounted on an octocopter two flight campaigns at 70m and 100m altitude were performed to evaluate the effect Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) and image overlap. To avoid comission errors and improve the terrain interpolation the point clouds were classified based on the geometric characteristics of the classes, i.e. (1) palm, (2) other vegetation (3) and ground. The mapping accuracy amounts for 86.1 % for the entire study area and 98.2 % for dense growing palm stands. We conclude that this flexible and automatic approach has high capabilities for operational use.</p>},

These characteristics make them especially amenable to be used in vegetable covers to stabilize slopes. In this context, 6 native species which usually grow on old road slopes in the mediterranean area of Chile were chosen to be used to revegetate slopes using the hydroseeding technique. 2 trials were carried out in a germination chamber with the aim to determinate the seeds' germination requirements. The germination capacity was tested under pre-germination treatments as soaking in either cold or hot water, and cold stratification. Stratified seeds of Melica violacea germinated after 5 days, and seeds of Baccharis linearis soaked in hot water showed their maximum germination energy on day 7, reaching a germination capacity of 99% and 91% respectively. Both species seems to be promising for revegetating slopes with the hydroseeding technique.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences. Pan-sharpening is the process of transferring the spatial resolution of panchromatic (PAN) image to a multispectral (MS) image for producing a single image with high spatial detail and rich spectral information. In this study, PAN and MS imagery of Quickbird-2 and Landsat-8 are fused separately, using ten different pan-sharpening methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), modified-intensity hue saturation (M-IHS), multiplicative, brovey transform (BT), wavelet-principal component analysis (W-PCA), hyperspectral color space (HCS), high-pass filter (HPF), Gram-Schmidt (GS), Fuze Go, and non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The effectiveness of these techniques is assessed and compared by qualitative analysis and 14 quantitative analysis methods including bias, correlation coefficient (CC), difference in variance (DIV), relative dimensionless global error in synthesis (ERGAS), universal image quality index (Q), relative average spectral error (RASE), root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index method (SSIM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak SNR (PSNR), spatial correlation coefficient (SCC), image entropy (E), and gradient and quality with no reference image (QNR). The results of both analysis types show that the Fuze Go and NSCT produced the best fused image with high spatial detail and rich spectral information followed by the HPF and GS.},

@article{Wittig2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: During the last decades ecological conditions in West Africa have dramatically changed. Very evident is the climate change, which has resulted in a southward shift of the climate zones, e.g. a spread of the desert (Sahara) into the Sahelian zone. After the drought period of the early 1970s and 1980s, livestock density increased resulting in an intensification of grazing pressure. This anthropogenous phenomenon leads to similar landscape changes as those caused by the climate. Only very few investigations exist on vegetation dynamics, climate changes and land use changes for the Sudanian zone. The paper presents data on changes of precipitation, of land use, of the geographical range of species, and of the composition of the flora, which have to be regarded as proofs of the sahelisation of large areas of the Sudanian zone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Area of investigation: Burkina Faso. Precipitation data analysis: precipitation data from 67 stations; time series analysis and geo-statistical spatial interpolation. Analysis of land use change: Landsat satellite MSS and ETM+ data, acquired for two different dates between 1972 and 2001 analyzed by the software ERDAS/IMAGINE version 8.6 and ArcView 3.2 with the Spatial Analyst extension. Intensive ground truthing (160 training areas). Inventory of the flora: based on the data of the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) in Frankfurt, Germany, and of the herbarium of the university of Ouagadougou (OUA), Burkina Faso, as well as on various investigations on the vegetation of Burkina Faso carried out in the years 1990 to 2005 by the team of the senior author. Life form analysis of the flora: based on the inventory of permanent plots. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Precipitation: Remarkable latitudinal shift of isohyets towards the South translates to a general reduction of average rainfall in great parts of the country. The last decade (1990-1999) shows some improvement, however, the more humid conditions of the 1950's and 1960's are not yet established again. Landcover change: In the study region the extent of arable fields and young fallows increased during the last 30 years from 580 km(2) in 1972 to 2870 km(2) in 2001. This means an average land cover conversion rate of 0.9% per year for the 6 departments considered. Change of the distribution of Sahelian and Sudanian species: Several species, mentioned in older literature as strictly Sahelian, today also occur in the Sudanian zone. Parallel to the spread of former strictly Sahelian species into the Sudanian zone, some former Sahelo-Sudanian species have withdrawn from the Sahel. Changes of the life form spectra of the flora: Considering their life form spectra, the flora of heavily grazed and of protected areas in the Sudanian zone show great differences. On areas intensively grazed the percentage of therophytes is evidently higher than on protected areas. Just the opposite is true for the phanerophytes. Their percentage is higher on the protected area than on the grazed zones. At the first glance, it is obvious to link the changes in flora and vegetation with the climate changes that have occurred during the last five decades (decrease of annual precipitation). However, not only climatic conditions have changed, but also population has increased, the percentage of land intensively used for agriculture and pasturing has increased and the time for soil regeneration today is much shorter than it was some decades ago. Thus, the landscape of the Sudanian zone has become a more Sahelian character. A comparison of the flora of an intensively used area of the Sudanian zone with that of a protected area shows a remarkable change in the life form spectra. The spectrum of the intensively used area is almost identical with that of the typical Sahelian flora. This comparison shows that the anthropogenic influence plays a greater role in the sahelisation of the Sudanian zone than the climate change. CONCLUSION: Climate change and anthropogenic influence both, lead to a sahelisation of landscape and flora. Thus in many parts of the Sudanian zone of West Africa sahelisation phenomena will remain and even increase independently from the reestablishment of the more humid climate conditions of the 1950ies. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: In order to maintain some parts of the characteristic Sudanian landscape with its characteristic flora and vegetation, the number and size of protected areas should be augmented. For all protected areas it has to be ensured, that protection is reality, i.e. respected an understood by local people, not only fiction. As long as the enlargement of intensively used areas continues the sahelisation of flora, vegetation and landscape will continue too.},

Non iterative methods such as the cumulative root frequency method and the geometric stratum boundaries are implemented. Optimal designs, with stratum boundaries that minimize either the CV of the simple expansion estimator for a fixed sample size n or the n value for a fixed CV can be constructed. Two iterative algorithms are available to find the optimal stratum boundaries. The design can feature a user defined certainty stratum where all the units are sampled. Take-all and take-none strata can be included in the stratified design as they might lead to smaller sample sizes. The sample size calculations are based on the anticipated moments of the survey variable Y, given the stratification variable X. The package handles conditional distributions of Y given X that are either a heteroscedastic linear model, or a log-linear model. Stratum specific non-response can be accounted for in the design construction and in the sample size calculations. Key},

@article{Of2005,
abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {Landsat occupies a unique position in the constellation of civilian earth observation satellites, with a long and rich scientific and applications heritage. With nearly 40. years of continuous observation - since launch of the first satellite in 1972 - the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

@article{Noss1990,
abstract = {Biodiversity is presently a minor consideration in environmental policy. It has been regarded as too broad and vague a concept to be applied to real-world regulatory and management problems. This problem can be corrected if biodiversity is recognized as an end in itself, and if measurable indicators can be selected to assess the status of biodiversity over time. Biodiversity, as presently understood, encompasses multiple levels of biological organization. In this paper, I expand the three primary attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin - composition, structure, and function-into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population-species, and genetic. Indicators of each attribute in terrestrial ecosystems, at the four levels of organization, are identified for environmental monitoring purposes. Projects to monitor biodiversity will benefit from a direct linkage to long-term ecological research and a commitment to test hypotheses relevant to biodiversity conservation. A general guideline is to proceed from the top down, beginning with a coarse-scale inventory of landscape pattern, vegetation, habitat structure, and species distributions, then overlaying data on stress levels to identify biologically significant areas at high risk of impoverishment. Intensive research and monitoring can be directed to high-risk ecosystems and elements of biodiversity, while less intensive monitoring is directed to the total landscape (or samples thereof). In any monitoring program, particular attention should be paid to specifying the questions that monitoring is intended to answer and validating the relationships between indicators and the components of biodiversity they represent.},

abstract = {Objectives: Exposure to ambient temperature can affect mortality levels for days or weeks following exposure, making modelling such effects in regression analysis of daily time-series data complex. Methods: We propose a new approach involving a multi-lag segmented approximation to account for the nonlinear effect of temperature and the use of two different penalised spline bases to model the distributed lag of both heat and cold exposure. Compared with standard splines, the novel penalised framework is more flexible at short lags where change in coefficients is greatest, and selection of the maximum lag appears substantially less important in determining the overall pattern of the effect. Results: Applying the approach to daily mortality in Santiago (Chile) and Palermo (Italy), we observed a heat effect that was mostly immediate and followed by negative estimates consistent with short-term mortality displacement (harvesting). Cold effects were mostly positively sustained and more evenly distributed across the 60-day analysis period: in Santiago we estimated an overall increase in deaths of 2.36% (95% CI 0.26% to 4.51%) in the 65+ age group associated with every 1°C decrease below the cold threshold, and an increase of 1.11% (0.09% to 2.14%) per 1°C for Palermo. Heat effects for Palermo were much larger than for Santiago, and less harvesting of heat deaths was evident. The estimated heat thresholds were higher in Palermo than in Santiago. Conclusions: Our approach provides a flexible and precise method to quantify health effects of both heat and cold exposure at individual lags and to model the overall pattern of the delayed effect.},

In a nation-wide study, the extent to which long-distance commuting increases the odds that couples will separate is investigated through event history analysis. Discrete-time logistic regression models were employed with longitudinal data on Swedish couples in 2000 to explore the odds of separation following long-distance commuting during 1995 to 2005. As expected, the results show that separation rates are higher among long-distance commuting couples compared with non-commuting couples. More complex results show that for men the odds of separating are highest if the commuting is on a temporary basis, and that women's odds decrease when they continue commuting for a longer time-period. The long-distance commuting effect on relationships also varies depending on residential context.},

abstract = {High resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) represent fundamental data for a wide range of Earth surface process studies. Over the past years, the German TanDEM-X mission acquired data for a new, truly global Digital Elevation Model with unprecedented geometric resolution, precision and accuracy. First TanDEM Intermediate Digital Elevation Models (i.e. IDEM) with a geometric resolution from 0.4 to 3 arcsec have been made available for scientific purposes in November 2014. This includes four 1° × 1° tiles covering the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Here, we document the results of a local scale IDEM height accuracy validation exercise utilizing over 10,000 RTK-GNSS-based ground survey points from fourteen sites characterized by mainly pristine Savanna vegetation. The vertical precision of the ground checkpoints is 0.02 m (1$\sigma$). Selected precursor data sets (SRTMGL1, SRTM41, ASTER-GDEM2) are included in the analysis to facilitate the comparison. Although IDEM represents an intermediate product on the way to the new global TanDEM-X DEM, expected to be released in late 2016, it allows first insight into the properties of the forthcoming product. Remarkably, the TanDEM-X tiles include a number of auxiliary files providing detailed information pertinent to a user-based quality assessment. We present examples for the utilization of this information in the framework of a local scale study including the identification of height readings contaminated by water. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for the high precision and accuracy of IDEM height readings and the sensitivity to canopy cover. For open terrain, the 0.4 arcsec resolution edition (IDEM04) yields an average bias of 0.20 ± 0.05 m (95% confidence interval, Cl95), a RMSE = 1.03 m and an absolute vertical height error (LE90) of 1.5 [1.4, 1.7] m (Cl95). The corresponding values for the lower resolution IDEM editions are about the same and provide evidence for the high quality of the IDEM products across the different resolution classes. Compared to the selected precursor DSMs, TanDEM-X will provide elevation data not only with up to 2.5 times higher geometric resolution and a 5–10 times higher vertical accuracy clearly outperforming the LE90 ⩽ 10 m benchmark.},

abstract = {The controls of forest vegetation, wildfires, and harvest vegetation disturbances on the frequency and magnitude of sediment delivery from a small watershed (∼3.9 km2) in the Idaho batholith are investigated through numerical modeling. The model simulates soil development based on continuous bedrock weathering and the divergence of diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes. Soil removal is due to episodic gully erosion, shallow landsliding, and debris flow generation. In the model, forest vegetation provides root cohesion and surface resistance to channel initiation. Forest fires and harvests reduce the vegetation. Vegetation loss leaves the land susceptible to erosion and landsliding until the vegetation cover reestablishes in time. Simulation results compare well with field observations of event sediment yields and long-term averages over ∼10,000 years. When vegetation is not disturbed by wildfires over thousands of years, sediment delivery is modeled to be less frequent but with larger event magnitudes. Increased values of root cohesion (representing denser forests) lead to higher event magnitudes. Wildfires appear to control the timing of sediment delivery. Compared to undisturbed forests, erosion is concentrated during the periods with low erosion thresholds, often called accelerated erosion periods, following wildfires. Our modeling suggests that drainage density is inversely proportional to root cohesion and that reduced forest cover due to wildfires increases the drainage density. We compare the sediment yields under anthropogenic (harvest) and natural (wildfire) disturbances. Disturbances due to forest harvesting appear to increase the frequency of sediment delivery; however, the sediment delivery following wildfires seems to be more severe. These modeling-based findings have implications for engineering design and environmental management, where sediment inputs to streams and the fluctuations and episodicity of these inputs are of concern.},

The shortage of good information on the distribution of alien species and their spatial dynamics is largely attributable to the cost, effort and expertise required to monitor these species over large areas. Virtual globes, particularly Google Earth, are free and user-friendly software which provide high-resolution aerial imagery for the entire globe. We suggest this has enormous potential for invasion science.We provide suggestions and tools for gathering data on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien trees using visual interpretation of Google Earth imagery, and propose how these data may be used for a number of purposes, including calculating useful metrics of invasions, prioritising species or areas for management and predicting potential distributions of species. We also suggest various practical uses of Google Earth, such as providing a tool for early detection of emerging invasions, monitoring invasions over time, and to help researchers and managers identify suitable field study sites. Virtual globes such as Google Earth are not without limitations and we provide guidance on how some of these can be overcome, or when imagery from Google Earth may not be fit for invasion science purposes. Because of Google Earth's huge popularity and ease of use, we also highlight possibilities for awareness-raising and information sharing that it provides. Finally, we provide the foundations and guidelines for a virtual global network of sentinel sites for early detection, monitoring and data gathering of invasive alien trees, which we propose should be developed as part of a ‘‘citizen science'' effort. There has been limited use of virtual globes by invasion scientists and managers; it is our hope that this paper will stimulate their greater use, both within the field of invasion science and within ecology generally.},

abstract = {Interactive image processing techniques, along with a linear-programming-based inductive classifier, have been used to create a highly accurate system for diagnosis of breast tumors. A small fraction of a fine needle aspirate slide is selected and digitized. With an interactive interface, the user initializes active contour models, known as snakes, near the boundaries of a set of cell nuclei. The customized snakes are deformed to the exact shape of the nuclei. This allows for precise, automated analysis of nuclear size, shape and texture. Ten such features are computed for each nucleus, and the mean value, largest (or 'worst') value and standard error of each feature are found over the range of isolated cells. After 569 images were analyzed in this fashion, different combinations of features were tested to find those which best separate benign from malignant samples. Ten-fold cross-validation accuracy of 97% was achieved using a single separating plane on three of the thirty features: mean texture, worst area and worst smoothness. This represents an improvement over the best diagnostic results in the medical literature. The system is currently in use at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The same feature set has also been utilized in the much more difficult task of predicting distant recurrence of malignancy in patients, resulting in an accuracy of 86%.},

The BISE method retains more valuable elements of an NDVI profile than the MVC. NDVI profiles prepared using the BISE method show strong differences in the development characteristics of various West African vegetation types.},

abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66% [33]). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass the reported human-level performance (5.1%, [26]) on this dataset.},

abstract = {Pr{\'{o}}logo La movilizaci{\'{o}}n mundial tras los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio (ODM) ha generado el movimiento contra la pobreza m{\'{a}}s exitoso de la historia. El compromiso transcendental que asumieron los l{\'{i}}deres del mundo en el a{\~{n}}o 2000 de " no escatimar esfuerzos para liberar a nuestros semejantes, hombres, mujeres y ni{\~{n}}os de las condiciones abyectas y deshumanizadoras de la pobreza extrema " , fue plasmado en un marco de trabajo inspirador de ocho objetivos, y despu{\'{e}}s en pasos pr{\'{a}}cticos de amplio espectro que han permitido a personas de todo el mundo mejorar sus vidas y sus perspectivas de futuro. Los ODM ayudaron a que m{\'{a}}s de mil millones de personas escaparan de la pobreza extrema, a combatir el hambre, a facilitar que m{\'{a}}s ni{\~{n}}as asistieran a la escuela que nunca antes, y a proteger nuestro planeta. Generaron nuevas e innovadoras colaboraciones, impulsaron la opini{\'{o}}n p{\'{u}}blica y mostraron el inmenso valor de establecer objetivos ambiciosos. Al ubicar a las personas y sus necesidades inmediatas en un primer plano, los ODM reconfiguraron la toma de decisiones tanto en pa{\'{i}}ses desarrollados como en pa{\'{i}}ses en desarrollo. A pesar de los notables logros, estoy profundamente consciente de que las desigualdades persisten y que el progreso ha sido desigual. La pobreza contin{\'{u}}a concentrada predominantemente en algunas partes del mundo. En 2011, casi el 60% de los mil millones de personas extremadamente pobres del mundo viv{\'{i}}a en solo cinco pa{\'{i}}ses. Demasiadas mujeres todav{\'{i}}a mueren durante el embarazo o debido a complicaciones del parto. El progreso tiende a pasar por alto a las mujeres y a aquellos que se encuentran en los escalones econ{\'{o}}micos m{\'{a}}s bajos, o que est{\'{a}}n en desventaja debido a su edad, discapacidad o etnia. Las desigualdades entre las zonas rurales y urbanas siguen siendo pronunciadas. Las experiencias y las pruebas de los esfuerzos para alcanzar los ODM han demostrado que sabemos qu{\'{e}} hacer. Pero para lograr mayores progresos necesitaremos una voluntad pol{\'{i}}tica inquebrantable y un esfuerzo colectivo a largo plazo. Tenemos que enfrentar las ra{\'{i}}ces de las causas y hacer m{\'{a}}s por integrar las dimensiones econ{\'{o}}micas, sociales y ambientales del desarrollo sostenible. La emergente agenda para el desarrollo despu{\'{e}}s de 2015, que incluir{\'{a}} un conjunto de Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible, pugna por reflejar estas lecciones, construir sobre la base de nuestros {\'{e}}xitos, y encaminar juntos y firmemente a todos los pa{\'{i}}ses hacia un mundo m{\'{a}}s pr{\'{o}}spero, sostenible y equitativo.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to promote the use of solar energy in powering traffic signal systems for rural areas in Qatar with no power grid. A photovoltaic system is needed in order to use this energy continuously. The results of the investigation of components, design, and market availability are shown in the paper. Solar cells, which are used for absorbing sunlight and generating electric current, are the main source for the system's operation. A charge controller is used to control the flow of charge through the battery and to protect the battery from overcharging and deep discharging. A dc-dc converter is used to regulate the output voltage which depends on the type of dc to dc converter. Lead acid batteries are used as the electric energy storage for the PV system to use electrical energy in the absence of sunlight. The principle operation of the system and the feasibility of using it for rural area with no power grid have been studied. For this project, a mount tracker was constructed that enabled the solar panel to be placed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 degree angles in order to determine which angle and what time provides the optimum voltage. Experimental results for different angles of radiation at different times of the day and different days of the year are shown in the paper.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Factors affecting vulnerability to heat-related mortality are not well understood. Identifying susceptible populations is of particular importance given anticipated rising temperatures from climatic change. METHODS: We investigated heat-related mortality for three Latin American cities (Mexico City, Mexico; S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile) using a case-crossover approach for 754 291 deaths from 1998 to 2002. We considered lagged exposures, confounding by air pollution, cause of death and susceptibilities by educational attainment, age and sex. RESULTS: Same and previous day apparent temperature were most strongly associated with mortality risk. Effect estimates remained positive though lowered after adjustment for ozone or PM(10). Susceptibility increased with age in all cities. The increase in mortality risk for those >or=65 comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of same-day apparent temperature was 2.69% (95% CI: -2.06 to 7.88%) for Santiago, 6.51% (95% CI: 3.57-9.52%) for S{\~{a}}o Paulo and 3.22% (95% CI: 0.93-5.57%) for Mexico City. Patterns of vulnerability by education and sex differed across communities. Effect estimates were higher for women than men in Mexico City, and higher for men elsewhere, although results by sex were not appreciably different for any city. In S{\~{a}}o Paulo, those with less education were more susceptible, whereas no distinct patterns by education were observed in the other cities. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated temperatures are associated with mortality risk in these Latin American cities, with the strongest associations in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, the hottest city. The elderly are an important population for targeted prevention measures, but vulnerability by sex and education differed by city.},

These indices have been widely implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Up to date, there is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity of different light spectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed and tested against a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that combine visible light radiation, mainly green spectra region, from vegetation, and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface. In the real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the specific application requirements coupled with appropriate validation tools and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics of vegetation and summarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews more than 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according to the vegetation of interest, environment, and implementation precision. Predictably, research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms, would have a wide applicability in different areas.},

@article{Garzelli2018,
abstract = {Whenever vegetated areas are monitored over time, phenological changes in land cover should be decoupled from changes in acquisition conditions, like atmospheric components, Sun and satellite heights and imaging instrument. This especially holds when the multispectral (MS) bands are sharpened for spatial resolution enhancement by means of a panchromatic (Pan) image of higher resolution, a process referred to as pansharpening. In this paper, we provide evidence that pansharpening of visible/near-infrared (VNIR) bands takes advantage of a correction of the path radiance term introduced by the atmosphere, during the fusion process. This holds whenever the fusion mechanism emulates the radiative transfer model ruling the acquisition of the Earth's surface from space, that is for methods exploiting a multiplicative, or contrast-based, injection model of spatial details extracted from the panchromatic (Pan) image into the interpolated multispectral (MS) bands. The path radiance should be estimated and subtracted from each band before the product by Pan is accomplished. Both empirical and model-based estimation techniques of MS path radiances are compared within the framework of optimized algorithms. Simulations carried out on two GeoEye-1 observations of the same agricultural landscape on different dates highlight that the de-hazing of MS before fusion is beneficial to an accurate detection of seasonal changes in the scene, as measured by the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI).},

@article{Huang2010,
abstract = {A highly automated algorithm called vegetation change tracker (VCT) has been developed for reconstructing recent forest disturbance history using Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This algorithm is based on the spectral-temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2-3 h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80% were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user's and producer's accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70% and 60% in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with no-change classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes resulting from sheep grazing upon upland peat soils have never been fully quantified. Previous studies have been limited to individual flux pathways or to comparing the presence to the absence of sheep grazing. Therefore, this study combines a model of the physical impact of grazing with models of: biomass production; energy usage in sheep; and peat accumulation. These combined modelling approaches enabled this study to consider the indirect and direct impacts of sheep upon the carbon and greenhouse gas balance of a peatland at different grazing intensities as well as the changes between grazing intensities. The study considered four vegetation scenarios (Calluna sp., Molinia sp.; reseeded grasses, and Agrostis-Festuca grassland) and a mixed vegetation scenario based upon the vegetation typical of upland peat ecosystems in northern England. Each scenario was considered for altitudes between 350 and 900 m above sea level and for grazing intensities between 0.1 and 2 ewes/ha. The study can show that the total GHG flux at the vegetative carrying capacity tended to decline with increasing altitude for all vegetation scenarios considered except for Molinia sp. The average total GHG flux for all scenarios was 1505 kg CO(2)eq/ha/yr/(ewe/ha), and on average 89% of the fluxes were directly from the sheep and not from the soil, and are therefore not unique to a peat soil environment. The study suggests that emission factors for upland sheep have been greatly underestimated. By comparing the total flux due to grazers to the flux to or from the soil that allows the study to define a GHG carry capacity, i.e. the grazing intensity at which the flux due to grazing is equal to the sink represented by the peat soils, this GHG carrying capacity varies between 0.2 and 1.7 ewes/ha with this capacity declining with increasing altitude for all model scenarios.},

abstract = {Given the low accuracy of the traditional remote sensing image processing software when orthorectifying satellite images that cover mountainous areas, and in order to make a full use of mutually compatible and complementary characteristics of the remote sensing image processing software PCI-RPC (Rational Polynomial Coefficients) and ArcGIS-Spline, this study puts forward a new operational and effective image processing procedure to improve the accuracy of image orthorectification. The new procedure first processes raw image data into an orthorectified image using PCI with RPC model (PCI-RPC), and then the orthorectified image is further processed using ArcGIS with the Spline tool (ArcGIS-Spline). We used the high-resolution CBERS-02C satellite images (HR1 and HR2 scenes with a pixel size of 2 m) acquired from Yangyuan County in Hebei Province of China to test the procedure. In this study, when separately using PCI-RPC and ArcGIS-Spline tools directly to process the HR1/HR2 raw images, the orthorectification accuracies (root mean square errors, RMSEs) for HR1/HR2 images were 2.94 m/2.81 m and 4.65 m/4.41 m, respectively. However, when using our newly proposed procedure, the corresponding RMSEs could be reduced to 1.10 m/1.07 m. The experimental results demonstrated that the new image processing procedure which integrates PCI-RPC and ArcGIS-Spline tools could significantly improve image orthorectification accuracy. Therefore, in terms of practice, the new procedure has the potential to use existing software products to easily improve image orthorectification accuracy.},

abstract = {Multiple fires in quick succession can cause an abrupt switch from forest to non-forest vegetation in some biomes. A prime example of such type conversion concerns alpine ash forests (Eucalyptus delegatensis subsp. delegatensis), which are endemic to the Australian Alps bioregion. These forests are long lived and can only regenerate following fire disturbance through the release of seed from the tree canopy, but complete regeneration failure of the eucalypt overstorey can occur if immature stands are subsequently reburnt. Wildfires in 2003, 2007 and 2009 burnt over 87% of the Alpine ash forest in Victoria, with some areas being burnt a second or third time within a decade by the 2013 Harrietville-Alpine Bushfire. Using aerial and field surveys we demonstrated that an area burnt two or three times in the Alpine National Park in Victoria would have resulted in loss of alpine ash forest were it not for an aerial sowing program. This sowing program used reduced sowing rates compared to those typically used in forestry silviculture operations in Victoria. Seedling establishment during the first year was lower on sown than natural seedfall areas but fell within the range of acceptable silvicultural stocking rates. Analysis of cohorts of seedlings over their first summer showed mortality was highest in the 2-3. months following emergence, especially during hot dry periods, but there was no difference in mortality rates between artificially and naturally sown areas. While the aerial sowing intervention established a cohort of alpine ash seedlings, the challenge for land managers is to protect these seedlings from wildfires for the next two decades to avoid loss of these forests.},

abstract = {The Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) of northern Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, Canada is the second largest contiguous peatland complex in the world, currently containing more than half of Canada's soil carbon. Recent concerns about the ecohydrological impacts to these large northern peatlands resulting from climate change and resource extraction have catalyzed a resurgence in scientific research into this ecologically important region. However, the sheer size, heterogeneity and elaborate landscape arrangements of this ecosystem raise important questions concerning representative sampling of environmental media for chemical or physical characterization. To begin to quantify such variability, this study assessed the small-scale spatial (1m) and short temporal (21 day) variability of surface pore-water biogeochemistry (pH, dissolved organic carbon, and major ions) in a Sphagnum spp.-dominated, ombrotrophic raised bog, and a Carex spp.-dominated intermediate fen in the HBL. In general, pore-water pH and concentrations of dissolved solutes were similar to previously reported literature values from this region. However, systematic sampling revealed consistent statistically significant differences in pore-water chemistries between the bog and fen peatland types, and large within-site spatiotemporal variability. We found that microtopography in the bog was associated with consistent differences in most biogeochemical variables. Temporal changes in dissolved solute chemistry, particularly base cations (Na(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)), were statistically significant in the intermediate fen, likely a result of a dynamic connection between surficial waters and mineral-rich deep groundwater. In both the bog and fen, concentrations of SO4(2-) showed considerable spatial variability, and a significant decrease in concentrations over the study period. The observed variability in peatland pore-water biogeochemistry over such small spatial and temporal scales suggests that under-sampling in northern peatland environments could lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the abundance and distribution of natural elements and pollutants alike.},

abstract = {—We developed a new two-step approach for auto-mated masking of clouds and their shadows in Landsat imagery. The first step consists of detecting clouds and cloud shadows in every Landsat image independently by using the Fmask algorithm. We modified two features of the original Fmask: we dropped the termination criterion for shadow matching, and we appended a darkness filter to counteract false positives in bifidly structured dryland areas. The second step utilizes the scene-by-scene detec-tions of the first step and additional time series of cloud and cloud shadow probabilities. All clear-sky observations of a pixel are used to estimate the probabilities' median and standard deviation. Any observation that deviates more than a multiple of the standard deviation from the median is considered an outlier and thus a remaining cloud or cloud shadow. The method was specifically designed for use in water-limited dryland areas, where event-based precipitation is predominant. As an effect, green vegetation peaks are highly variable, in timing, magnitude, and frequency, with adverse effects on commonly used Fourier-based outlier detection methods. The method is designed to be robust even if temporally dense data coverage is not available.},

abstract = {A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250. pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250. pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98% and user's accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90%. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This research uses a longitudinal data set of commuting behavior to test the nature and strength of the association between residential change and employment location. Do households minimize commuting distances when they change residences and what are the differences for one-worker and two-worker households? The analysis utilizes descriptive measures of distance and time to work for pre- and post-residential relocations and develops estimates from a probability model of work-place attraction. We extend earlier research on commuting distances by using a multinodal rather than a monocentric city, by specifically considering the commuting responses of two-worker households and by formally estimating a model of the response to commuting distances. The findings indicate that both one- and two-worker households with greater separation between workplace and residence make decreases in distance and time. Overall, as other studies have shown, women commute shorter distances and are more likely to minimize commuting after a move than are men. The probability model fits the likelihood of decreasing distance with greater separation and provides a more exact specification of the connection between residence and workplace than previous analyses of this relationship. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This study proposes a method for assessing the probability that land management interventions will lead to an improvement in the carbon sink represented by peat soils. The method is able to: combine studies of different carbon uptake and release pathways in order to assess changes on the overall carbon or greenhouse gas budget; calculate the probability of the management or restoration leading to an improvement in the budget; calculate the uncertainty in that probability estimate; estimate the equivalent number of complete budgets available from the combination of the literature; test the difference in the outcome of different land management interventions; and provide a method for updating the predicted probabilities as new studies become available. Using this methodology, this study considered the impact of: afforestation, managed burning, drainage, drain-blocking, grazing removal; and revegetation, on the carbon budget of peat soils in the UK. The study showed that afforestation, drain-blocking, revegetation, grazing removal and cessation of managed burning would bring a carbon benefit, whereas deforestation, managed burning and drainage would bring a disbenefit. The predicted probabilities of a benefit are often equivocal as each management type or restoration often leads to increase in uptake in one pathway while increasing losses in another.},

Nondegraded and degraded areas in the same LCU (paired areas) were compared by: (i) testing for differences in spatial mean ???NDVI values, (ii) calculating the relative degradation impact (RDI) as the difference between the spatial mean ???NDVI values of paired areas expressed as a percentage of nondegraded mean value, (iii) investigating the relationship between RDI and rainfall and (iv) comparing the resilience and stability of paired areas in response to natural variations in rainfall. The ???NDVI of degraded areas was significantly lower for most of the LCUs. Relative degradation impacts (RDI) across all LCUs ranged from 1% to 20% with an average of 9%. Although ???NDVI was related to rainfall, RDI was not. Degraded areas were no less stable or resilient than nondegraded. However, the productivity of degraded areas, i.e., the forage production per unit rainfall, was consistently lower than nondegraded areas, even within years of above normal rainfall. The results indicate that there has not been a catastrophic reduction in ecosystem function within degraded areas. Instead, degradation impacts were reflected as reductions in productivity that varied along a continuum from slight to severe, depending on the specific LCU. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Software tools have been developed at the U.S. Geological Surveys EROS Data Center to extract topographic structure and to delineate watersheds and overland flow paths from digital elevation models. The tools are special purpose FORTRAN programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original DEM with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal to the number of cells that drain to it. The original DEM and these three derivative data sets can then be processed in a variety of ways to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for further analysis. Comparisons between these computer generated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing.},

abstract = {Background: The widespread availability of new computational methods and tools for data analysis and predictive modeling requires medical informatics researchers and practitioners to systematically select the most appropriate strategy to cope with clinical prediction problems. In particular, the collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers methodological and technical solutions to deal with the analysis of medical data and construction of prediction models. A large variety of these methods requires general and simple guidelines that may help practitioners in the appropriate selection of data mining tools, construction and validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of predictive models within clinical environments. Purpose: The goal of this review is to discuss the extent and role of the research area of predictive data mining and to propose a framework to cope with the problems of constructing, assessing and exploiting data mining models in clinical medicine. Methods: We review the recent relevant work published in the area of predictive data mining in clinical medicine, highlighting critical issues and summarizing the approaches in a set of learned lessons. Results: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines to carry out data mining studies in this field. Conclusions: Predictive data mining is becoming an essential instrument for researchers and clinical practitioners in medicine. Understanding the main issues underlying these methods and the application of agreed and standardized procedures is mandatory for their deployment and the dissemination of results. Thanks to the integration of molecular and clinical data taking place within genomic medicine, the area has recently not only gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems it needs to address. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

@article{Kennedy2015,
abstract = {To understand causes and consequences of landscape change, it is often not enough to simply detect change. Rather, the agent causing the change must also be determined. Here, we describe and test a method of change agent attribution built on four tenets: agents operate on patches rather than pixels; temporal context can provide insight into the agent of change; human interpretation is critical because agent labels are inherently human-defined; and statistical modeling must be flexible and non-parametric. In the Puget Sound, USA, we used LandTrendr Landsat time-series-based algorithms to identify abrupt disturbances, and then applied spatial rules to aggregate these to patches. We then derived a suite of spectral, patch-shape, and landscape position variables for each patch. These were then linked to patch-level training labels determined by interpreters at 1198 training patches, and modeled statistically using the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm. Labeled agents of change included urbanization, forest management, and natural change (largely fire), as well as labels associated with spectral change that was non-informative (false change). The success of the method was evaluated using both out-of-bag (OOB) error and a small, fully-independent validation interpretation dataset. Overall OOB accuracy was above 80%, but most successful in the numerically well-represented forest management class. Validation with the independent data was generally lower than that estimated with the OOB approach, but comparable when either first or second voting scores were used for prediction. Spatial and temporal patterns within the study area followed expectations well, with most urbanization occurring in the lower elevation regions around Seattle-Tacoma, most forest management occurring in mid-slope managed forests, and most natural disturbance occurring in protected areas. Temporal patterns of change agent aggregated to the watershed level suggest substantial year-over-year variability that could be used to examine year-over-year variability in fish species populations.},

abstract = {<p>An understanding of risks to biodiversity is needed for planning action to slow current rates of decline and secure ecosystem services for future human use. Although the IUCN Red List criteria provide an effective assessment protocol for species, a standard global assessment of risks to higher levels of biodiversity is currently limited. In 2008, IUCN initiated development of risk assessment criteria to support a global Red List of ecosystems. We present a new conceptual model for ecosystem risk assessment founded on a synthesis of relevant ecological theories. To support the model, we review key elements of ecosystem definition and introduce the concept of ecosystem collapse, an analogue of species extinction. The model identifies four distributional and functional symptoms of ecosystem risk as a basis for assessment criteria: A) rates of decline in ecosystem distribution; B) restricted distributions with continuing declines or threats; C) rates of environmental (abiotic) degradation; and D) rates of disruption to biotic processes. A fifth criterion, E) quantitative estimates of the risk of ecosystem collapse, enables integrated assessment of multiple processes and provides a conceptual anchor for the other criteria. We present the theoretical rationale for the construction and interpretation of each criterion. The assessment protocol and threat categories mirror those of the IUCN Red List of species. A trial of the protocol on terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems from around the world shows that its concepts are workable and its outcomes are robust, that required data are available, and that results are consistent with assessments carried out by local experts and authorities. The new protocol provides a consistent, practical and theoretically grounded framework for establishing a systematic Red List of the world's ecosystems. This will complement the Red List of species and strengthen global capacity to report on and monitor the status of biodiversity</p>},

abstract = {Changes in species composition and diversity are the inevitable consequences of climate change, as well as land use and land cover change. Predicting species richness at regional spatial scales using remotely sensed biophysical variables has emerged as a viable mechanism for monitoring species distribution. In this study, we evaluate the utility of MODIS-based productivity (GPP and EVI) and surface water content (NDSVI and LSWI) in predicting species richness in the semi-arid region of Inner Mongolia, China. We found that these metrics correlated well with plant species richness and could be used in biome- and life form-specific models. The relationships were evaluated on the basis of county-level data recorded from the Flora of Inner Mongolia, stratified by administrative (i.e., counties), biome boundaries (desert, grassland, and forest), and grouped by life forms (trees, grasses, bulbs, annuals and shrubs). The predictor variables included: the annual, mean, maximum, seasonal midpoint (EVImid), standard deviation of MODIS-derived GPP, EVI, LSWI and NDSVI. The regional pattern of species richness correlated with GPPSD (R2 = 0.27), which was also the best predictor for bulbs, perennial herbs and shrubs (R2 = 0.36, 0.29 and 0.40, respectively). The predictive power of models improved when counties with > 50% of cropland were excluded from the analysis, where the seasonal dynamics of productivity and species richness deviate patterns in natural systems. When stratified by biome, GPPSD remained the best predictor of species richness in grasslands (R2 = 0.30), whereas the most variability was explained by NDSVImax in forests (R2 = 0.26), and LSWIavg in deserts (R2 = 0.61). The results demonstrated that biophysical estimates of productivity and water content can be used to predict plant species richness at the regional and biome levels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A method to predict vascular plant richness using spectral and textural variables in a heterogeneous wetland is presented. Plant richness was measured at 44 sampling plots in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland. Several spectral indices, first-order statistics (median and standard deviation), and second-order statistics [metrics of a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)] were extracted from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image and a Pleiades 1B image. We selected the most important variables for predicting richness using recursive feature elimination and then built a model using random forest regression. The final model was based on only two textural variables obtained from the GLCM and derived from the Landsat 8 image. An accurate predictive capability was reported (R2 = 0.6; RMSE = 1.99 species), highlighting the possibility of obtaining parsimonious models using textural variables. In addition, the results showed that the mid-resolution Landsat 8 image provided better predictors of richness than the high-resolution Pleiades image.

With a crystal ball, one could pick the predictor in $\mu$^(⋅,s){\hat{\mu}(\cdot, s)} having minimum prediction error. Without prescience, one uses test sets, cross-validation and so forth. The difference in prediction error between the crystal ball selection and the statistician's choice we call predictive loss. For an unstable procedure the predictive loss is large. This is shown by some analytics in a simple case and by simulation results in a more complex comparison of four different linear regression methods. Unstable procedures can be stabilized by perturbing the data, getting a new predictor sequence $\mu$′^(⋅,s){\hat{\mu'}(\cdot, s)} and then averaging over many such predictor sequences.},

abstract = {There is currently a great deal of interest in the quantitative characterization of temporal and spatial vegetation patterns with remotely sensed data for the study of earth system science and global change. Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the L factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant L in the SAVI equation with a variable L function is presented in this article. The L function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a “vegetation signal” to “soil noise” ratio.},

The dynamic of consolidation of urban areas in Latin America has allowed that almost 80% of the population concentrates in cities; this has produced changes in land covers and modified regional climate, propitiating the appearance of urban heat islands. The Metropolitan Area of Toluca, State of Mexico, Mexico, holds the fifth national place in population size and experiences this process, because of this, the objective is to analyze and compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of the atmospheric urban heat island obtained from data gathered from 12 urban and rural weather stations with the surface urban heat island obtained from the digital processing of four Landsat 8 images. Results show the year-round presence of night-time atmospheric urban heat islands, which reach a peak in autumn (up to 6 °C). Daytime atmospheric urban heat islands occur in summer and autumn with a maximum intensity of 4 °C. For their part, surface urban heat islands occur in spring, summer and autumn and reach maximums of 19 °C in intensity. A strong correlation was found between wetness and surface temperature (coefficient of determination, 0.8) in spring and winter. Soil wetness directly impacts the formation of weak urban heat islands in dry season, and intense ones in wet season, while the green areas and the winds affect the spatial distribution of the same.},

abstract = {The Andes foothills of central Chile are characterized by high levels of floristic diversity in a scenario, which offers little protection by public protected areas. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of this diversity must be gained in order to aid in conservation management. Heterogeneous environmental conditions involve an important number of niches closely related to species richness. Remote sensing information derived from satellite hyperspectral and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can be used as proxies to generate a spatial prediction of vascular plant richness. This study aimed to estimate the spatial distribution of plant species richness using remote sensing in the Andes foothills of the Maule Region, Chile. This region has a secondary deciduous forest dominated by Nothofagus obliqua mixed with sclerophyll species. Floristic measurements were performed using a nested plot design with 60 plots of 225 m2 each. Multiple predictors were evaluated: 30 topographical and vegetation structure indexes from LiDAR data, and 32 spectral indexes and band transformations from the EO1-Hyperion sensor. A random forest algorithm was used to identify relevant variables in richness prediction, and these variables were used in turn to obtain a final multiple linear regression predictive model (Adjusted R2 = 0.651; RSE = 3.69). An independent validation survey was performed with significant results (Adjusted R2 = 0.571, RMSE = 5.05). Selected variables were statistically significant: catchment slope, altitude, standard deviation of slope, average slope, Multiresolution Ridge Top Flatness index (MrRTF) and Digital Crown Height Model (DCM). The information provided by LiDAR delivered the best predictors, whereas hyperspectral data were discarded due to their low predictive power.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {Land surface topography is one of the most important terrain properties which impact hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological processes active on a landscape. In our previous efforts to develop a soil depth model based upon topographic and land cover variables, we derived a set of hydrological proximity measures (HPMs) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as potential explanatory variables for soil depth. These HPMs are variations of the distance up to ridge points (cells with no incoming flow) and variations of the distance down to stream points (cells with a contributing area greater than a threshold), following the flow path. The HPMs were computed using the D-infinity flow model that apportions flow between adjacent neighbors based on the direction of steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets constructed in a 3×3 grid cell window using the center cell and each pair of adjacent neighboring grid cells in turn. The D-infinity model typically results in multiple flow paths between 2 points on the topography, with the result that distances may be computed as the minimum, maximum or average of the individual flow paths. In addition, each of the HPMs, are calculated vertically, horizontally, and along the land surface. Previously, these HPMs were calculated using recursive serial algorithms which suffered from stack overflow problems when used to process large datasets, limiting the size of DEMs that could be analyzed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a message passing interface (MPI) parallel approach designed to both increase the size and speed with which these HPMs are computed. The parallel HPM algorithms spatially partition the input grid into stripes which are each assigned to separate processes for computation. Each of those processes then uses a queue data structure to order the processing of cells so that each cell is visited only once and the cross-process communications that are a standard part of MPI are handled in an efficient manner. This parallel approach allows efficient analysis of much larger DEMs than were possible using the serial recursive algorithms. The HPMs given here may also have other, more general modeling applicability in hydrology, geomorphology and ecology, and so are described here from a general perspective. In this paper, we present the definitions of the HPMs, the serial and parallel algorithms used in their computation and their potential applications. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {The effective use of satellite image time series for examining vegetation response patterns across regional extents requires a method which accounts for variation at the seasonal scale while simultaneously detecting abrupt changes in any long term trends. The Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithmhas been developed to do this. However, its effectiveness in semi-arid regions, where vegetation response is typically aseasonal, has yet to be assessed. In this research the BFAST algorithmwas assessed for a semi-arid study area in the Paroo catchment of far northwestern New SouthWales, Australia. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) EVI time series were decomposed using BFAST for 270 sample pixels to assess the algorithm's ability to detect abrupt changes in vegetation response caused by known fires and floods. The algorithm was also applied across the study area to examine regional patterns in the timing and magnitude of abrupt changes and the direction and magnitude of the long term trends. The timing of breaks detected by BFAST corresponded with the timing of known floods in the study region for between 68% and 79% of breaks detected across the sample pixels, depending on the parameters used in the decomposition. BFAST was not, however, able to accurately detect fires in the Paroo region, with agreement between the timing of breaks and fires occurring in only 3% of breaks detected. Thismost likely reflects the low EVI values present before a fire event, which would be typical of semi-arid zones. Spatial patterns in the timing of abrupt changes and greening and browning trends across the study area were a function of land cover and vegetation type. These results indicate that BFAST is able to detect abrupt changes in vegetation greening caused by known floods in semi-arid regions. The presence of spatial patterns in the results also indicates that the algorithm is sensitive to vegetation cover type. BFAST is therefore able to detect abrupt trend changes in regionswhere vegetation response is not expected to show strong seasonal patterns and could be used in further applications such as classification or regional vegetation modelling in semi-arid environments.},

abstract = {This book addresses the socio-economic impacts of rapid economic development due to a global mining boom. It reviews the efforts taken by communities, governments and companies in Australia to deliver enduring benefits while minimising the negative consequences of rapid growth. In particular, the effects and tensions of new workforce arrangements, worker mobility and condensed mine life cycles on communities and economies are explored. Split into two parts, the first part of the book details various issues related to the socio-economic impacts of Labour Force Mobility and Rapid Economic Growth, while the second part focuses on measuring the socio-economic impacts of Rapid Economic Growth. Chapter contributors have technical and scientific backgrounds which have been informed by social perspectives. They understand the technical and economic spheres of the resources industries and recognize the gaps in the public policy which hinder regional economic development during a period of extraordinary growth and opportunity. The book is a useful resource for practitioners in the public policy, resources, community planning and economic development sectors as well as students in business, regional planning and human resources.},

abstract = {Impacts of long distance commuting (LDC) on a host region have been a topic of research interest for some time. Recently, however, criticisms have surfaced about the validity of studies which address this topic. Specifically, temporal variability and spatial interaction have rarely been considered. This article argues that a single model which jointly incorporates these two aspects can improve the predictive power of LDC impacts. Using spatial panel modelling, 516 Local Government Areas (LGAs) across Australia over two census periods (2006 and 2011) were used to explore drivers of LDC. It was found that local labour market characteristics had minimal influence on recruitment strategies of firms that typically use LDC. Housing affordability does not impact on the decision of non-resident workers to either migrate into a region or adopt LDC into that region. However, local service provision and the availability of rental accommodation reduces the uptake of LDC. In addition, higher turnover of the resident population erodes social capital in host regions, which reduces the attractiveness of the local area and leads to increased use of LDC.},

abstract = {Species richness increases markedly during the first years after fire, driven mainly by the increase in the number of herbaceous species. However, such increase is variable in space and time, due to the role that the different plant life-forms can play after the fire disturbance. In addition, the absence of reliable species richness information can be a limitation for decision making when postfire management actions are needed. In this study we used QuickBird imagery to develop multiscale, spatially explicit predictive models of species richness in a burned area 1year after a fire. The study area is an abandoned dehesa (a Quercus suber (cork oak) open woodland with shrubs) of central Spain, which had been affected by a large summer fire. Two 90×180m macroplots were established, where species richness and percentage cover of various plant life-forms were measured at three spatial scales (1, 25, and 100m 
                        2). Total plant species richness was related to reflectance and spectral contrast derived from the multispectral bands of QuickBird and to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), by using regression tree analysis (RTA) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Furthermore, for the biophysical support of such models, plant species richness was related to field-based compositional data, and life-form percentage cover to satellite data. Results indicated that the relationship between species richness, reflectance and spectral contrast was strong and scale-dependent (1m 
                        2: adjusted R 
                        2=0.50; 25m 
                        2: adj. R 
                        2=0.65; 100m 
                        2: adj. R 
                        2=0.79), whereas NDVI played a minor role at all scales. At the finest sampling scale, a low range of species richness was related to a high variability of spectral and texture responses, due to the excess of spatial detail of the pixel size. At 25m 
                        2, a higher range of species richness was related to a low variability of spectral and texture responses; this was probably due to the fact that the sampling size only captured certain portions of plant individuals or life-form associations. At the largest sampling scale (100m 
                        2), the highest variability of species richness was adequately related to the spectral and texture responses, due to the spatial fit between the sampling plot size and both the pixel- and plant-sizes. Species richness was closely linked to life-form percentage cover (mainly to herbaceous plant cover), and life-form cover was adequately explained by satellite data, giving a biophysical support to our predictive models. Reflectance and spectral contrast were good predictive tools of total plant species richness at the largest sampling scale, but their predictive power diminished at the smaller scales. This was explained by the range of species richness measured at each scale, the spatial arrangement of species, and the ratio of the spatial resolution (both for pixels from satellite data and for ground sampling plots) to the size of the objects. These results contribute to improve our knowledge about the link between high spatial resolution remotely sensed data and species richness at different sampling scales. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The invasion of woody vegetation into deserts, grasslands and savannas is generally thought to lead to an increase in the amount of carbon stored in those ecosystems. For this reason, shrub and forest expansion (for example, into grasslands) is also suggested to be a substantial, if uncertain, component of the terrestrial carbon sink. Here we investigate woody plant invasion along a precipitation gradient (200 to 1,100 mm yr(-1)) by comparing carbon and nitrogen budgets and soil delta(13)C profiles between six pairs of adjacent grasslands, in which one of each pair was invaded by woody species 30 to 100 years ago. We found a clear negative relationship between precipitation and changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen content when grasslands were invaded by woody vegetation, with drier sites gaining, and wetter sites losing, soil organic carbon. Losses of soil organic carbon at the wetter sites were substantial enough to offset increases in plant biomass carbon, suggesting that current land-based assessments may overestimate carbon sinks. Assessments relying on carbon stored from woody plant invasions to balance emissions may therefore be incorrect.},

About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.},

abstract = {Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning.In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92% overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20%, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level. ?? 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Savannas occur where trees and grasses interact to create a biome that is neither grassland nor forest. Woody and gramineous plants interact by many mechanisms, some negative (competition) and some positive (facilitation). The strength and sign of the interaction varies in both time and space, allowing a rich array of possible outcomes but no universal predictive model. Simple models of coexistence of trees and grasses, based on separation in rooting depth, are theoretically and experimentally inadequate. Explanation of the widely observed increase in tree biomass following introduction of commercial ranching into savannas requires inclusion of interactions among browsers, grazers, and fires, and their effects on tree recruitment. Prediction of the consequences of manipulating tree biomass through clearing further requires an understanding of how trees modify light, water, and nutrient environments of grasses. Understanding the nature of coexistence between trees and grass, which under other circumstances...},

@article{Elith2008,
abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization iti function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitives highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

The spatial distribution of topographic attributes can often be used as an indirect measure of the spatial variability of these processes and allows them to be mapped using relatively simple techniques. Many geographic information systems are being developed that store topographic information as the primary data for analysing water resource and biological problems. Furthermore, topography can be used to develop more physically realistic structures for hydrologic and water quality models that directly account for the impact of topography on the hydrology. Digital elevation models are the primary data used in the analysis of catchment topography. We describe elevation data sources, digital elevation model structures, and the analysis of digital elevation data for hydrological, geomorphological, and biological applications. Some hydrologic models that make use of digital representations of topography are also considered.},

In this study, TanDEM-X CoSSC data were processed to produce DEMs at 6 m spatial resolution for two test areas of India. The generated DEMs were compared with DEMs available from airborne LiDAR, photogrammetry, SRTM and ICESat elevation point data. The first test site is in Bihar state of India with almost flat terrain and sparse vegetation cover and the second test site is around Godavari river in Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) state of India with flat to moderate hilly terrain. The quality of the DEMs in these two test sites has been specified in terms of most widely used accuracy measures viz. mean, standard deviation, skew and RMSE. The TanDEM-X DEM over Bihar test area gives 5.0 m RMSE by taking airborne LiDAR data as reference. With ICESat elevation data available at 9000 point locations, RMSE of 5.9 m is obtained. Similarly, TanDEM-X DEM for Godavari area was compared with high resolution aerial photogrammetric DEM and SRTM DEM and found RMSE of 5.3 m and 7.5 m respectively. When compared with ICESat elevation data at several point location and also the same point locations of photogrammetric DEM and SRTM, the RMS errors are 4.1 m, 3.5 m and 4.3 m respectively. DEMs were also compared for open-pit coal mining area where elevation changes from -147 m to 189 m. X- and Y-profiles of all DEMs were also compared to see their trend and differences.</p>},

abstract = {In recent years, type II diabetes has become a serious disease that threaten the health and mind of human. Efficient predictive modeling is required for medical researchers and practitioners. This study proposes a type II diabetes prediction model based on random forest which aims at analyzing some readily available indicators (age, weight, waist, hip, etc.) effects on diabetes and discovering some rules on given data. The method can significantly reduce the risk of disease through digging out a clear and understandable model for type II diabetes from a medical database. Random forest algorithm uses multiple decision trees to train the samples, and integrates weight of each tree to get the final results. The validation results at school of medicine, University of Virginia shows that the random forest algorithm can greatly reduce the problem of over-fitting of the single decision tree, and it can effectively predict the impact of these readily available indicators on the risk of diabetes. Additionally, we get a better prediction accuracy using random forest than using the naive Bayes algorithm, ID3 algorithm and AdaBoost algorithm.},

abstract = {This study examines whether MODIS NDVI satellite data time series can be used to detect land degradation and regeneration areas in Mongolia. Time series analysis was applied to an 11-year MODIS NDVI satellite data record, based on the hypothesis that the resulting NDVI residual trend vectors would enable successful detection of changes in photosynthetically active vegetation. We performed regression analysis, derived regression slope values, and generated a map of significant trends. We also examined land cover development and meteorological data for the same period. 11-year time series of MODIS 16-day composite NDVI data proved sufficient for deriving statistically significant trend values for 50% of Mongolia's surface. MODIS land cover products proved suitable for identifying areas of vegetation cover change. Areas showing positive and negative NDVI trends mostly coincided with areas of land cover class change indicating an increase or a decrease in vegetation, respectively. Precipitation changes in the same time period seem to have had an influence on large NDVI trend areas. The NDVI time series trend analysis methodology applied successfully detected changes due to deforestation, forest fires, mining activities, urban expansion, and grassland regeneration. These findings demonstrate that NDVI time series trend analysis is suitable for detecting vegetation change areas and for identifying land degradation and regeneration.},

abstract = {Predicting the economic and demographic impacts of resource development on regional areas is difficult to assess because of limited availability of analysis, difficulties of predicting where workforce are likely to be based, and different impacts on communities because of variations in size and economic structures. In this study modelling has been employed to identify future employment and demographic impacts of future resource developments on communities in the Surat Basin in southern Queensland, Australia. The analysis summarises potential employment increases over multiple projects and uses multipliers from Input-Output models to assess likely impacts by local government area when future workforce might commute to or live locally in the region. The results demonstrate that recent moves to commuting workforces limit the economic impacts on local and regional communities in complex ways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Bangladesh is the deltaic flood plain located in the lower ridge of the Ganges Brahmaputra and Meghna basins. The country is very flat having 40% of its landmass up to 10 m above the mean sea level. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 90 m, i.e., 3-arc second digital elevation model (DEM) is being widely used to delineate river network and to extract catchment information using hydrology tool of ArcGIS. The hydrology tool uses the D8 method for extraction of drainage pattern. The study was carried out to find the limitation and suitability of 90 m SRTM DEM data in flat terrains especially in Bangladesh using ArcGIS. Twelve catchments of varying geomorphology were chosen from five hydrological zones of Bangladesh. Basin characteristics such as bifurcation ratio, drainage density, and channel slope of the catchments were estimated and analyzed to evaluate the suitability of 90 m SRTM DEM. The delineated catchments of slope 1:3,600 or more flat shows large deviation in river network alignment when compared with the digital river network developed by Bangladesh Water Development Board and with Google Earths images. The catchments having slope 1:2,850 and more steep were delineated correctly. The conclusion could not be established between slopes 1:2,850 and 1:3,600. The study also revealed that the catchment characteristics other than the slope have no effect on river network delineation.},

The results showed Aster GDEM and SRTM have significant different values compared to BPDAS (Government Field Data) but generally morphometric information was still in the same class range. However, DEM generation failed to determine channel network. DEM produced by SRTM had better elevation accuracy than Aster GDEM contrary to the resolution of elevation on each DEM source.},

abstract = {Aggregate hierarchy and porosity changes in aggregate beds as a consequence of wetting-drying cycles were studied in two Andisols and one Mollisol from Chile, collected at two depths. Bulk density and indirect tensile strength were measured in aggregates of different sizes. Aggregate beds were prepared in cylinders with two size classes. Six wetting-drying cycles between 0 and -60 hPa were applied. Bulk density (Db) of soil matrix was controlled after each cycle, and the macroporosity was calculated. A repellency index was measured in one of the Andisols. In addition, also the air permeability was measured after the sixth cycle. It could be proofed, that the aggregate strength is an appropriate parameter to evaluate the aggregate hierarchy, and this parameter is also more sensitive than aggregate Db to discriminate between the effects of land-use intensity. Aggregate strength is furthermore well correlated with changes in pore water pressure and can be applied to relate strength values with aggregate development level. Only if the predrying exceeds pF > 3.0, aggregate strength correlates with Db. The more pronounced is the land-use, the higher is the increase of Db values for aggregate beds. The decrease of coarse porosity during wetting-drying cycles can be explained by mass differences between saturated and equilibrated water conditions that considers the water around aggregates and within the contact area. Nevertheless, the relation of relative macroporosity change, calculated by P-exped where D-agg IS the Db measured by clod method, and the relative Db change, is useful to explain possible presence of coarse pores inside the aggregates. The newly formed porosity prevents the water repellency, but after six cycles of drying, the repellency index increased in the topsoil while we could detect a decrease in the subsoil samples (under defined conditions in the laboratory) which we assume to be caused by microbial activity. The approaching of aggregates by drying cycles generates in Andisols a reduced area to air fluxes, with low values of air permeability.},

abstract = {This technical note discusses the radiometric use of WorldView-3 imagery. The first two sections briefly describe the WorldView-3 instrument and general radiometric performance including the WorldView-3 relative spectral radiance response and relative radiometric correction of WorldView-3 products. Section 3 covers conversion to top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance and conversion to top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance. WorldView-3 imagery MUST be converted to spectral radiance at a minimum before radiometric/spectral analysis or comparison with imagery from other sensors in a radiometric/spectral manner. The information contained in this technical note applies to the raw WorldView-3 sensor performance and linearly scaled top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance products. Caution is advised when applying the equations provided here to pan-sharpened products, dynamic range adjusted (DRA) products, or WorldView-3 mosaics with radiometric balancing because the generation of these products may apply non-linear transformations to the pixel DN values. 1 WorldView-3 Instrument The WorldView-3 high-resolution commercial imaging satellite was launched on August 13, 2014, from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The satellite is in a nearly circular, sun-synchronous orbit with a period of 97 minutes, an altitude of approximately 617 km, and with a descending nodal crossing time of approximately 10:30 a.m. The revisit is 4.5 days at a greater than 20-deg off nadir angle. WorldView-3 acquires 11-bit data in 9 spectral bands covering panchromatic, coastal, blue, green, yellow, red, red edge, NIR1, and NIR2. An additional shortwave infrared (SWIR) sensor acquires 14-bit data in eight bands covering the 1100 to 2500 nm spectral region. See Table 1 for details. At nadir, the collected nominal ground sample distance is 0.31 m (panchromatic), 1.24 m (multispectral) and 3.7 m (SWIR). Commercially available products are resampled to 0.3 m (panchromatic), 1.2 m (multispectral) and 7.5 m (SWIR). The nominal swath width is 13.1 km (slightly less for the SWIR sensor). The WorldView-3 instrument is a pushbroom imager, which constructs an image one row at a time as the focused image of the Earth through the telescope moves across the linear detector arrays, which are located on the focal plane.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

@article{Installe2014,
abstract = {Background: Using machine-learning techniques, clinical diagnostic model research extracts diagnostic models from patient data. Traditionally, patient data are often collected using electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) systems, while mathematical software is used for analyzing these data using machine-learning techniques. Due to the lack of integration between eCRF systems and mathematical software, extracting diagnostic models is a complex, error-prone process. Moreover, due to the complexity of this process, it is usually only performed once, after a predetermined number of data points have been collected, without insight into the predictive performance of the resulting models. Objective: The objective of the study of Clinical Data Miner (CDM) software framework is to offer an eCRF system with integrated data preprocessing and machine-learning libraries, improving efficiency of the clinical diagnostic model research workflow, and to enable optimization of patient inclusion numbers through study performance monitoring. Methods: The CDM software framework was developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach, to ensure high software quality. Architecturally, CDM's design is split over a number of modules, to ensure future extendability. Results: The TDD approach has enabled us to deliver high software quality. CDM's eCRF Web interface is in active use by the studies of the International Endometrial Tumor Analysis consortium, with over 4000 enrolled patients, and more studies planned. Additionally, a derived user interface has been used in six separate interrater agreement studies. CDM's integrated data preprocessing and machine-learning libraries simplify some otherwise manual and error-prone steps in the clinical diagnostic model research workflow. Furthermore, CDM's libraries provide study coordinators with a method to monitor a study's predictive performance as patient inclusions increase. Conclusions: To our knowledge, CDM is the only eCRF system integrating data preprocessing and machine-learning libraries. This integration improves the efficiency of the clinical diagnostic model research workflow. Moreover, by simplifying the generation of learning curves, CDM enables study coordinators to assess more accurately when data collection can be terminated, resulting in better models or lower patient recruitment costs.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of aboveground biomass and carbon stock has gained importance in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. In order to develop improved forest stratum–specific aboveground biomass and carbon estimation models for humid rainforest in northeast Madagascar, this study analyzed texture measures derived from WorldView-2 satellite data. A forest inventory was conducted to develop stratum-specific allometric equations for dry biomass. On this basis, carbon was calculated by applying a conversion factor. After satellite data preprocessing, vegetation indices, principal components, and texture measures were calculated. The strength of their relationships with the stratum-specific plot data was analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Biomass and carbon estimation models were developed by performing stepwise multiple linear regression. Pearson's correlation coefficients revealed that (a) texture measures correlated more with biomass and carbon than spectral parameters, and (b) correlations were stronger for degraded forest than for non-degraded forest. For degraded forest, the texture measures of Correlation, Angular Second Moment, and Contrast, derived from the red band, contributed to the best estimation model, which explained 84% of the variability in the field data (relative RMSE = 6.8%). For non-degraded forest, the vegetation index EVI and the texture measures of Variance, Mean, and Correlation, derived from the newly introduced coastal blue band, both NIR bands, and the red band, contributed to the best model, which explained 81% of the variability in the field data (relative RMSE = 11.8%). These results indicate that estimation of tropical rainforest biomass/carbon, based on very high resolution satellite data, can be improved by (a) developing and applying forest stratum–specific models, and (b) including textural information in addition to spectral information.},

abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

The data set was provided by the University of Pannonia, and it contains monthly precipitation data of 144 years of measurements (1,728 data points) from the Keszthely Meteorological Station. This data set is special because few stations in Hungary can provide such long and continuous measurements with detailed historical background. The results of the research can provide insight into the signs of climate change in the past for the region of West Balaton. Parametric methods (linear trend and t-test for slope) for analyzing time series are the simplest ones to obtain insight into the changes in a variable over time. These methods have a requirement for normal distribution of the residuals that can be a limitation for their application. Non-parametric methods are distribution-free and investigators can get a more sophisticated view of the variable tendencies in time series.},

abstract = {Remote sensing has made important contributions to biodiversity conservation planning through the measurement of deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, and isolation of protected areas in human altered landscapes. Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5??m resolution Quickbird and 30??m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120??m, 150??m and 240??m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat's temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The two principal innovations of the procedure: a drainage enforcement algorithm which automatically removes spurious sinks or pits in the fitted elevation grid, in recognition of the fact that sinks are normally quite rare in nature, and an algorithm which automatically calculates ridge and stream lines from points of locally maximum curvature on contour lines. These features are coupled to an efficient iterative finite difference interpolation technique which is based on minimising a rotation invariant roughness penalty. The drainage enforcement algorithm yields DEMs which may be used in hydrological process studies. Moreover, it facilitates the detection of errors in point elevation data that would not be detected by more conventional statistical means and forms a sound physical basis for cartographic generalization.},

abstract = {An evolving forest regeneration technique, based on the use of a "seed-containing aerial dart" (SCAD), provides for the delivery of seeds by helicopter through the distribution of darts, which serve as ground-penetrating containers for individual seeds. While many biological and technological aspects of this aerial sowing technique have been previously documented, the hitherto unpublished results of some growth experiments, carried out over a five-year period, are believed to offer the key to any future development. These simulated field experiments, although small in scale, demonstrate means for greatly improving the prospects for regeneration using aerial darts. Such means include dart configuration changes to provide for axially spaced seeds and the addition of slow-release fertilizer, when not in direct contact with seeds within the growth medium. Darts sown in the fall on mechanically undisturbed ground are shown not to be subject to frost heaving and lead to much earlier germination and faster growth than occurs with spring sowing. The presence of a surface layer of organic material is shown to be extremely beneficial in promoting vigorous seedling growth. The results confirm the potential applicability of the technique to sites, such as recently burned areas, with these characteristics, where acceptable regeneration performance is not an unrealistic objective.},

abstract = {Commercial multispectral satellite datasets, such as WorldView-2 and Geoeye-1 images, are often delivered with a high-spatial resolution panchromatic image (PAN) as well as a corresponding lower resolution multispectral image (MSI). Certain fine features are only visible on the PAN but are difficult to discern on the MSI. To fully utilize the high-spatial resolution of the PAN and the rich spectral information from the MSI, a pan-sharpening process can be carried out. However, difficulties arise in maintaining radiometric accuracy, particularly for applications other than visual assessment. We propose a fast pan-sharpening process based on nearest-neighbor diffusion with the aim to enhance the salient spatial features while preserving spectral fidelity. Our approach assumes that each pixel spectrum in the pan-sharpened image is a weighted linear mixture of the spectra of its immediate neighboring superpixels; it treats each spectrum as its smallest element of operation, which is different from the most existing algorithms that process each band separately. Our approach is shown to be capable of preserving salient spatial and spectral features. We expect this algorithm to facilitate fine feature extraction from satellite images.},

In particular, we present a feature preselection method, a more robust boosting procedure and a new approach for multicategorical problems. This allows for slight to drastic increase in performance and yields competitive results on several publicly available datasets.},

abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984???2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond.},

A new “drainage enforcement” algorithm is presented that insures drainage continuity through flat areas and out of depressions. This algorithm is based on the priority-first-search weighted-graph algorithm. Relatively simple methods for defining internal basins and incorporating digitized stream data are also discussed. All of the selected methods are robust, computationally efficient, and avoid many of the problems associated with other methods. In order to support this claim, the literature is reviewed and comparisons are made between the chosen methods and other methods.

abstract = {Previous studies have claimed that the Chilean matorral is more open than the Califonia chaparral, and have attributed this dissimilarity largely to the role of man in Chile. In this paper we show that in general the Chilean matorral has a structure better described as shrub clumps that merge to form a continuous vegetation matrix only in very mesic habitats, where it is comparable to the Califonia chaparral. We also present evidence that these clumps have been present for at least the last 26 years and that even without human disturbance they are likely to maintain themselves. Evidence for the latter pertains to seed dispersal, seed germination and establishment, seedling survival, and the diameter size structure of shrub clumps. Finally, we propose that differences between the California chaparral and Chilean matorral are more profound than previously thought and are due not only to different degrees of human disturbance, but also to the presence of periodical natural fires in California and not in Chile, and to different shrub recruitment patterns and mammalian herbivore activity in the two areas.},

abstract = {Changes of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) affect atmospheric, climatic, and biological spheres of the earth. Accurate LULC map offers detail information for resources management and intergovernmental cooperation to debate global warming and biodiversity reduction. This paper examined effects of pansharpening and atmospheric correction on LULC classification. Object-Based Support Vector Machine (OB-SVM) and Pixel-Based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (PB-MLC) were applied for LULC classification. Results showed that atmospheric correction is not necessary for LULC classification if it is conducted in the original multispectral image. Nevertheless, pansharpening plays much more important roles on the classification accuracy than the atmospheric correction. It can help to increase classification accuracy by 12% on average compared to the ones without pansharpening. PB-MLC and OB-SVM achieved similar classification rate. This study indicated that the LULC classification accuracy using PB-MLC and OB-SVM is 82% and 89% respectively. A combination of atmospheric correction, pansharpening, and OB-SVM could offer promising LULC maps from WorldView-2 multispectral and panchromatic images.},

abstract = {Assisted (or accelerated) natural regeneration (ANR) will play an important role in meeting the UN target to restore forest to 350 million hectares of degraded land, by 2030. However, since most accessible land is already used for agriculture, most of the sites, avail- able for ANR, are far from roads and/or on difficult terrain, where implementing ANR with human labour is not practical. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of emerging technologies, such as low-cost UAVs (drones) and new imaging devices, to automate ANR tasks, including site monitoring (to assess site potential for natural regeneration, plan interventions and assess progress), maintenance of natural regeneration (particularly weeding) and species enrichment through aerial seeding. The usefulness of existing technologies is reviewed and future innovations needed, to provide practicable support for ANR, are discussed. Intensive collaboration, among technol- ogists and forest ecologists, will be essential to ensure that technological innovations are based firmly on sound restoration science.},

abstract = {Pansharpening aims at fusing a multispectral and a panchromatic image, featuring the result of the processing with the spectral resolution of the former and the spatial resolution of the latter. In the last decades, many algorithms addressing this task have been presented in the literature. However, the lack of universally recognized evaluation criteria, available image data sets for benchmarking, and standardized implementations of the algorithms makes a thorough evaluation and comparison of the different pansharpening techniques difficult to achieve. In this paper, the authors attempt to fill this gap by providing a criti- cal description and extensive comparisons of some of the main state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. In greater details, several pansharpening algorithms belonging to the component substi- tution or multiresolution analysis families are considered. Such techniques are evaluated through the two main protocols for the assessment of pansharpening results, i.e., based on the full- and reduced-resolution validations. Five data sets acquired by differ- ent satellites allow for a detailed comparison of the algorithms, characterization of their performances with respect to the dif- ferent instruments, and consistency of the two validation proce- dures. In addition, the implementation of all the pansharpening techniques considered in this paper and the framework used for running the simulations, comprising the two validation procedures and the main assessment indexes, are collected in a MATLAB toolbox that is made available to the community},

The criterion is basically to extract the highest resolution (highest drainage density) network that satisfies scaling laws that have traditionally been found to hold for channel networks. Procedures that use this criterion are presented and tested on 21 digital elevation data sets well distributed throughout the U.S.},

abstract = {High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, "Random Forest" estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at ∼100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

abstract = {Forest disturbances influence many landscape processes, including changes in microclimate, hydrology, and soil erosion. We analyzed the spectral response and temporal progress of two types of disturbances of spruce forest (bark beetle outbreak and clear-cuts) in the central part of {\v{S}}umava Mountains at the border between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The bark beetle (Ips typographus [L.]) outbreak in this region in the last 20 years resulted in regional-scale spruce forest decay. Clear-cutting was done here to prevent further bark-beetle propagation in the buffer zones. The aim of the study is to identify the differences in spectral response between the two types of forest disturbances and their temporal dynamics. General trends were analyzed throughout the study area, with sampled disturbance areas selected to assess the relationship between field vegetation data and their spectral response. Thirteen Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes from 1985 to 2007 were used for the assessment. The following spectral indices were estimated: NDMI, Tasseled Cap (Brightness, Greenness, Wetness), DI, and DI′. The DI′, Wetness, and Brightness indices show the highest sensitivity to forest disturbance for both disturbance types (clear-cuts and bark beetle outbreak). The multitemporal analysis distinguished three different stages of development. The highest spectral differences between the clear-cuts and the bark beetle disturbances were found in the period between 1996 and 2004 with increased levels of forest disturbance (repeated measures ANOVA, Scheff{\'{e}} post hoc test; p ≤ 0.05). Clear-cut disturbance resulted in significantly higher spectral differences from the original forest and occurred as a more discrete event in comparison to bark beetle outbreak. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In boosting, successive trees give extra weight to points incorrectly predicted by earlier predictors. In the end, a weighted vote is taken for prediction.

We show that the proposed multi-class AdaBoost algorithm is equivalent to a forward stagewise additive mod-eling algorithm that minimizes a novel exponential loss for multi-class classification. Furthermore, we show that the ex-ponential loss is a member of a class of Fisher-consistent loss functions for multi-class classification.

abstract = {Remotely sensed data, with high spatial and temporal resolutions, can hardly be provided by only one sensor due to the tradeoff in sensor designs that balance spatial resolutions and temporal coverage. However, they are urgently needed for improving the ability of monitoring rapid landscape changes at fine scales (e.g., 30 m). One approach to acquire them is by fusing observations from sensors with different characteristics (e.g., Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)). The existing data fusion algorithms, such as the Spatial and Temporal Data Fusion Model (STDFM), have achieved some significant progress in this field. This paper puts forward an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Data Fusion Model (ESTDFM) based on the STDFM algorithm, by introducing a patch-based ISODATA classification method, the sliding window technology, and the temporal-weight concept. Time-series ETM+ and MODIS surface reflectance are used as test data for comparing the two algorithms. Results show that the prediction ability of the ESTDFM algorithm has been significantly improved, and is even more satisfactory in the near-infrared band (the contrasting average absolute difference [AAD]: 0.0167 vs. 0.0265). The enhanced algorithm will support subsequent research on monitoring land surface dynamic changes at finer scales.},

abstract = {Can species richness and rarity be predicted from space? If satellite-derived vegetation indices can provide us with accurate predictions of richness and rarity in an area, they can serve as an excellent tool in diversity and conservation research, especially in inaccessible areas. The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite images is enabling us to study this question more carefully. We sampled plant richness and rarity in 34 quadrats ( 1000 m(2)) along an elevation gradient between 300 and 2200 m focusing on Mount Hermon as a case study. We then used 10 Landsat, Aster, and QuickBird satellite images ranging over several seasons, going up to very high resolutions, to examine the relationship between plant richness, rarity, and vegetation indices calculated from the images. We used the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI), one of the most commonly used vegetation indexes, which is strongly correlated to primary production both globally and locally ( in more seasonal and in drier and/or colder environments that have wide ranges of NDVI values). All images showed a positive significant correlation between NDVI and both plant species richness and percentage tree cover ( with R-2 as high as 0.87 between NDVI and total plant richness and 0.89 for annual plant richness). The high resolution images enabled us to examine spatial heterogeneity in NDVI within our quadrats. Plant richness was significantly correlated with the standard deviation of NDVI values ( but not with their coefficient of variation) within quadrats and between images. Contrary to richness, relative range size rarity was negatively correlated with NDVI in all images, this result being significant in most cases. Thus, given that they are validated by fieldwork, satellite-derived indices can shed light on richness and even rarity patterns in mountains, many of which are important biodiversity centres.},

However, controversy continues regarding the relevance of BEF experiments to the complex ecosystems and large spatial and temporal scales of interest in conservation and management. Here, I address some of the persistent criticisms regarding experimental BEF research and argue that these have been overstated. Contrary to some suggestions, many putative artifacts attributed to experiments render their conclusions about BEF links stronger, rather than weaker. Like other broad ecological concepts, BEF focuses on general patterns, rather than looking at species-level, applied conservation problems. Nevertheless, insights from BEF experiments conducted to date are likely to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services in the real world. These experiments suggest that managing ecosystems to promote biodiversity can have important practical benefits.},

Their combination leads to CatBoost outperforming other publicly available boosting implementations in terms of quality on a variety of datasets. Two critical algorithmic advances introduced in CatBoost are the implementation of ordered boosting, a permutation-driven alternative to the classic algorithm, and an innovative algorithm for processing categorical features. Both techniques were created to fight a prediction shift caused by a special kind of target leakage present in all currently existing implementations of gradient boosting algorithms. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of this problem and demonstrate that proposed algorithms solve it effectively, leading to excellent empirical results.},

We study two WorldView-2 multispectral in-track sequences acquired over the cities of Atlanta, USA, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, consisting of 13 and 20 co-located images, respectively. The sequences possess off-nadir acquisition angles up to 47.5° and bear markedly different sun-satellite configurations with respect to each other. Both scenes comprise classic urban structures such as buildings of different size, road networks, and parks. First, we quantify the degree of distortion affecting the sequences by means of a non-linear measure of distance between probability distributions, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Second, we assess the ability of a classification model trained on an image acquired at a certain view angle to predict the land-cover of all the other images in the sequence. The portability across the sequence is investigated for supervised classifiers of different nature by analyzing the evolution of the classification accuracy with respect to the off-nadir look angle. For both datasets, the effectiveness of physically- and statistically-based normalization methods in obtaining angle-invariant data spaces is compared and synergies are discussed. The empirical results indicate that, after a suitable normalization (histogram matching, atmospheric compensation), the loss in classification accuracy when using a model trained on the near-nadir image to classify the most off-nadir acquisitions can be reduced to as little as 0.06 (Atlanta) or 0.03 (Rio de Janeiro) Kappa points when using a SVM classifier.},

A novel crossover technique called Segmented Multi-chromosome Crossover is also introduced. It maintains the information contained in gene segments and allows offspring to inherit information from multiple parent chromosomes. The improved GA is applied for the automatic and simultaneous parameter optimization and feature selection of multi-layer perceptron network in medical disease diagnosis.

abstract = {Vegetation indices and transformations have been used extensively in forest change detection studies. In this study, we processed multitemporal normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW) data sets and compared their statistical relationships and relative efficiencies in detecting forest disturbances associated with forest type and harvest intensity at five, two and one year Landsat acquisition intervals. The NDMI and TCW were highly correlated (>0.95 r2) for all five image dates. There was no significant difference between TCW and NDMI for detecting forest disturbance. Using either a NDMI or TCW image differencing method, when Landsat image acquisitions were 5 years apart, clear cuts could be detected with nearly equal accuracy compared to images collected 2 years apart. Partial cuts had much higher commission and omission errors compared to clear cut. Both methods had 7-8% higher commission and 12-22% higher omission error to detect hardwood disturbance when it occurred in the first year of the 2-year interval (as compared to 1-year interval). Softwood and hardwood change detection errors were slightly higher at 2-year Landsat acquisition intervals compared to 1-year interval. For images acquired 1 and 2 years apart, NDMI forest disturbance commission and omission errors were slightly lower than TCW. The NDMI can be calculated using any sensor that has near-infrared and shortwave bands and is at least as accurate as TCW for detecting forest type and intensity disturbance in biomes similar to the Maine forest, particularly when Landsat images are acquired less than 2 years apart. Where partial cutting is the most dominant harvesting system as is currently the case in northern Maine, we recommend images collected every year to minimize (particularly omission) errors. However, where clear cuts or nearly complete canopy removal occurs, Landsat intervals of up to 5 years may be nearly as accurate in detecting forest change as 1 or 2 year intervals. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Most diabetics know little about their health quality or the risk factors they face prior to diagnosis.

The main problems that we are trying to solve are to improve the accuracy of the prediction model, and to make the model adaptive to more than one dataset. Based on a series of preprocessing procedures, the model is comprised of two parts, the improved K-means algorithm and the logistic regression algorithm. The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis toolkit were utilized to compare our results with the results from other researchers. The conclusion shows that the model attained a 3.04% higher accuracy of prediction than those of other researchers. Moreover, our model ensures that the dataset quality is sufficient. To further evaluate the performance of our model, we applied it to two other diabetes datasets. Both experiments' results show good performance. As a result, the model is shown to be useful for the realistic health management of diabetes.},

However, most studies only investigated one or two classification algorithms and feature encoding schemes. In this study, we applied seven different classification algorithms on GWAS case-control data sets for seven different diseases to create models for disease risk prediction. Further, we used three different encoding schemes for the genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and investigated their influence on the predictive performance of these models. Our study suggests that an additive encoding of the SNP data should be the preferred encoding scheme, as it proved to yield the best predictive performances for all algorithms and data sets. Furthermore, our results showed that the differences between most state-of-the-art classification algorithms are not statistically significant. Consequently, we recommend to prefer algorithms with simple models like the linear support vector machine (SVM) as they allow for better subsequent interpretation without significant loss of accuracy.

abstract = {The effect of land use changes on the woody cover and patchiness of the Orinoco lowlands was analyzed from 1951 to 1997 by using a stretched exponential model in terms of the patch size distribution. We selected five production systems on the basis of the following components: policy option, technology and environment. They are: (a) high-input pasture in deep soil (DL-HIGraz), (b) low-input cropping in deep soil (DH-LOCrop), (c) high-input cropping in deep soil (DH-HICrop), (d) low-input cropping in shallow soil (SL-LOCrop) and (e) extensive cattle grazing in shallow soil (SL-LOGraz). For comparison, stands with similar soil depth and woody density (DL-Fallow, DH-Fallow and SL-Fallow) were selected at the protected Biological Reserve in the Calabozo region. Results indicate that the distribution of the patches was described by the stretched exponential distribution model with c as the exponent distribution. The magnitude of c reflected the effect of land use changes over time. Thus, the parameter c for human impacted stands was higher than that for the fallow stands. The stretched exponential model implies that the human impact had a multiscalar effect on the Orinoco mosaic, in terms of the multiplicative processes. There is a generic mechanism exhibiting an anomalous distribution of the patches such as has been proposed for physical systems. Therefore, the number of generation of the multiplicative processes (i.e. inverse of c) for impacted stands was lower than that in the fallow stands. As the time from fallow establishment proceeded, there was a tendency to patch re-organization by biotic effects.},

abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes (> 0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01-0.07 $\sigma$) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1-0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Vegetation phenology describing the seasonal cycle of plants is currently one of the main concerns in the study of climate change and carbon balance estimation in ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques which can capture canopy reflectance allow vegetation photosynthetic capacity to be assessed. In this study, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements were used to identify onset date of greenness in deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) over the continental United States from year 2000 to 2008. Onset dates determined by these three indices were compared with North American First Leaf Lilac Phenology Data over the same time period. NDVI has a best agreement with the field data among the three vegetation indices. Spatial analysis was performed on the onset dates predicted with NDVI. Four major conclusions were drawn from this study are: 1) onset dates are not only dependent on latitude but also associated with ecoregions and altitudes; 2) onset of greenness moves northward gradually and the average change of onset dates along latitude is about 3. days per degree. Interannual variability of onset dates is greater at higher latitudes (>43 ??N) than at lower latitudes (???43 ??N); 3) at the same latitude, DBF in mountain area tends to green up latter and coastal forest tends to green up earlier than other ecoregions; and 4) the impact of altitude is more obvious when the range of elevation achieves more than 1000. m. These conclusions provide insight for assessing vegetation indices in determining onset date of greenness at regional scale, and can be exploited to analyze the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystem. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Citaci{\'{o}}n: Tirachini, A., Quiroz, M. (2016) Evasi{\'{o}}n del pago en transporte p{\'{u}}blico: evidencia internacional y lecciones para Santiago. Documento de Trabajo, Departamento de Ingenier{\'{i}}a Civil, Universidad de Chile, Julio de 2016. Puntos clave 1. La evasi{\'{o}}n en los buses de Transantiago se ha duplicado en 9 a{\~{n}}os y en la actualidad es una amenaza para la sustentabilidad financiera del sistema. 2. El nivel de evasi{\'{o}}n actual (alrededor de 28%) es desproporcionado cuando se compara con ciudades de Europa o Australia (evasi{\'{o}}n bajo 10%) o con el sistema Transmilenio en Bogot{\'{a}} (10-15% de evasi{\'{o}}n). 3. Se escoge las ciudades de Mendoza, Bogot{\'{a}}, Madrid, Londres, Berl{\'{i}}n y Melbourne para una comparaci{\'{o}}n internacional. Se estudia tres variables: (i) la probabilidad de ser fiscalizado, relacionado a la tasa de inspecci{\'{o}}n, (ii) la multa que se debe pagar por evadir, y (iii) una variable socioecon{\'{o}}mica definida como el porcentaje de gasto en transporte (relaci{\'{o}}n entre ingresos y tarifa), tanto para un hogar promedio como para el primer quintil de ingreso. 4. Se encuentra que el valor de la multa en Santiago es de los m{\'{a}}s altos entre los casos analizados, tanto en valor absoluto como relativo a la tarifa. 5. El gasto en transporte en Santiago es relativamente alto para personas de bajos recursos, comparado a las ciudades de Mendoza y Bogot{\'{a}} (si en Bogot{\'{a}} el usuario recibe la tarifa subsidiada SISBEN). Sin embargo esta variable por s{\'{i}} sola no explica el excesivo nivel de evasi{\'{o}}n en Santiago, ya que el gasto en transporte se ha mantenido m{\'{a}}s o menos constante desde el inicio de Transantiago, mientras la evasi{\'{o}}n se ha duplicado. 2 6. La baja tasa de fiscalizaci{\'{o}}n s{\'{i}} es una variable relevante para explicar la evasi{\'{o}}n en Transantiago. La probabilidad promedio de ser fiscalizado en los buses de Santiago se estima en 0.11% (aproximadamente 1 en 1000), mientras en el transporte p{\'{u}}blico de Berl{\'{i}}n tal probabilidad es 0.55% (5 en 1000) y en Melbourne es 6.28% (63 en 1000). En sistemas de transporte p{\'{u}}blico abiertos en general las tasas de inspecci{\'{o}}n son mayores al 1%. 7. Basado en la evidencia y en la experiencia internacional en el combate a la evasi{\'{o}}n en el transporte p{\'{u}}blico, se hace las siguientes recomendaciones para Santiago: a. Incrementar significativamente y agilizar la fiscalizaci{\'{o}}n de evasi{\'{o}}n en los buses de Transantiago. Se debe aumentar la cantidad de fiscalizadores por bus y la cantidad de buses fiscalizados. Se recomienda permitir que en varios lugares la fiscalizaci{\'{o}}n y asignaci{\'{o}}n de multas pueda ser hecha sin la presencia de carabineros para poder ampliar el alcance de la fiscalizaci{\'{o}}n, y que adem{\'{a}}s se permita la fiscalizaci{\'{o}}n por inspectores vestidos de civil. b. La primera vez que un evasor sea infraccionado, la multa debe ser menor que en el caso de reincidencia. Adem{\'{a}}s se puede dar facilidades como descuentos si la multa se paga en el acto o a pocos d{\'{i}}as de cursada la infracci{\'{o}}n. c. Se debe hacer una fuerte campa{\~{n}}a publicitaria de concientizaci{\'{o}}n social, para desterrar la visi{\'{o}}n de que la evasi{\'{o}}n es una falta menor o que no es una falta en absoluto, arraigada en parte de la ciudadan{\'{i}}a. Se puede cambiar el t{\'{e}}rmino " evasi{\'{o}}n " a uno que realmente tenga una connotaci{\'{o}}n social negativa (como se hizo en Melbourne, un caso exitoso en reducci{\'{o}}n de la evasi{\'{o}}n). d. Se debe estudiar la implementaci{\'{o}}n de una tarifa preferencial para usuarios de bajos recursos. 8. Una reducci{\'{o}}n significativa de la evasi{\'{o}}n solo es posible con un paquete integrado de medidas en los diversos {\'{a}}mbitos descritos, donde la efectividad de cada medida se ver{\'{a}} potenciada por la implementaci{\'{o}}n de las dem{\'{a}}s. 9. La aplicaci{\'{o}}n de medidas como las planteadas tiene costos adicionales que, se espera, sean m{\'{a}}s que compensados por el aumento en los ingresos del sistema debido a la disminuci{\'{o}}n de la evasi{\'{o}}n. Se prev{\'{e}} que el costo de estas medidas va a disminuir en el tiempo, porque la primera etapa es de reducci{\'{o}}n del nivel actual de evasi{\'{o}}n, mientras que una segunda etapa, en r{\'{e}}gimen, consiste en el control de un nivel m{\'{a}}s tolerable de evasi{\'{o}}n. Transantiago debe aspirar a un nivel de evasi{\'{o}}n en buses menor al 10%, de acuerdo a las tasas de evasi{\'{o}}n observadas en la mayor{\'{i}}a de las ciudades estudiadas. 3 Contenido},

abstract = {The Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) has been widely used in the remote sensing community. However, TCT is sensor dependent, so a new sensor requires a reworking of the TCT starting with analysis of data structure of images. The purpose of this paper is to derive the TCT parameters for the Landsat 8 OLI TOA Reflectance images, and compare the differences between the Tasseled Cap Transformation parameters derived from the spring and autumn images. The results from this paper suggest that the TCT parameters derived from the image from October is most appropriate for regional remote sensing applications over the Yellow River Delta, China where atmospheric correction is not feasible.},

@article{Miranda2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergThe understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns in land use and land cover (LULC) change is a key issue for conservation efforts. In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970–1990 period. This decreased in the 1990–2000 period and rose again in the 2000–2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.},

abstract = {Remote sensing represents a powerful tool to derive quantitative and qualitative information about ecosystem biodiversity. In particular, since plant species richness is a fundamental indicator of biodiversity at the community and regional scales, attempts were made to predict species richness (spatial heterogeneity) by means of spectral heterogeneity. The possibility of using spectral variance of satellite images for predicting species richness is known as Spectral Variation Hypothesis. However, when using remotely sensed data, researchers are limited to specific scales of investigation. This paper aims to investigate the effects of scale (both as spatial and spectral resolution) when searching for a relation between spectral and spatial (related to plant species richness) heterogeneity, by using satellite data with different spatial and spectral resolution. Species composition was sampled within square plots of 100??m2 nested in macroplots of 10,000??m2. Spectral heterogeneity of each macroplot was calculated using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: a Quickbird multispectral image (4 bands, spatial resolution of 3??m), an Aster multispectral image (first 9 bands used, spatial resolution of 15??m for bands 1 to 3 and 30??m for bands 4 to 9), an ortho-Landsat ETM+ multispectral image (bands 1 to 5 and band 7 used; spatial resolution, 30??m), a resampled 60??m Landsat ETM+ image. Quickbird image heterogeneity showed a statistically highly significant correlation with species richness (r = 0.69) while coarse resolution images showed contrasting results (r = 0.43, r = 0.67, and r = 0.69 considering the Aster, Landsat ETM+, and the resampled 60??m Landsat ETM+ images respectively). It should be stressed that spectral variability is scene and sensor dependent. Considering coarser spatial resolution images, in such a case even using SWIR Aster bands (i.e. the additional spectral information with respect to Quickbird image) such an image showed a very low power in catching spectral and thus spatial variability with respect to Landsat ETM+ imagery. Obviously coarser resolution data tend to have mixed pixel problems and hence less sensitive to spatial complexity. Thus, one might argue that using a finer pixel dimension should inevitably result in a higher level of detail. On the other hand, the spectral response from different land-cover features (and thus different species) in images with higher spectral resolution should exhibit higher complexity. Spectral Variation Hypothesis could be a basis for improving sampling designs and strategies for species inventory fieldwork. However, researchers must be aware on scale effects when measuring spectral (and thus spatial) heterogeneity and relating it to field data, hence considering the concept of scale not only related to a spatial framework but even to a spectral one. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The goal of this study is to analyse the predictive performance of the random forest machine learning technique in comparison to commonly used hedonic models based on multiple regression for the prediction of apartment prices. A data set that includes 7407 records of apartment transactions referring to real estate sales from 2008-2013 in the city of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was used in order to test and compare the predictive performances of both models. Apparent challenges faced during modelling included (1) the non-linear nature of the prediction assignment task; (2) input data being based on transactions occurring over a period of great price changes in Ljubljana whereby a 28% decline was noted in six consecutive testing years; and (3) the complex urban form of the case study area. Available explanatory variables, organised as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) ready dataset, including the structural and age characteristics of the apartments as well as environmental and neighbourhood information were considered in the modelling procedure. All performance measures (R 2 values, sales ratios, mean average percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of dispersion (COD)) revealed significantly better results for predictions obtained by the random forest method, which confirms the prospective of this machine learning technique on apartment price prediction.},

abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

abstract = {A wide variety of similarity indices for comparing two assemblages based on species incidence (i.e., presence/absence) data have been proposed in the literature. These indices are generally based on three simple incidence counts: the number of species shared by two assemblages and the number of species unique to each of them. We provide a new probabilistic derivation for any incidence-based index that is symmetric (i.e., the index is not affected by the identity ordering of the two assemblages) and homogeneous (i.e., the index is unchanged if all counts are multiplied by a constant). The probabilistic approach is further extended to formulate abundance-based indices. Thus any symmetric and homogeneous incidence index can be easily modified to an abundance-type version. Applying the Laplace approximation formulas, we propose estimators that adjust for the effect of unseen shared species on our abundance-based indices. Simulation results show that the adjusted estimators significantly reduce the biases of the corresponding unadjusted ones when a substantial fraction of species is missing from samples. Data on successional vegetation in six tropical forests are used for illustration. Advantages and disadvantages of some commonly applied indices are briefly discussed.},

The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

abstract = {A growing number of people are long-distance commuters. For some long-distance commuting is a temporary solution, while as for others it can be a more long-term strategy to promote career and income. This study addresses duration of long-distance commuting - 30. km or more between home and work - in Sweden, and what characterizes individuals who commute for shorter or longer periods. The effects of long-distance commuting in terms of economic outcome for both partners in a commuter household are analysed. The study is based on register data for the years 1995-2005 covering all long-distance commuters in Sweden. One finding is that previous experience of long-distance commuting makes it more likely to have a long duration of long-distance commuting. In addition economic incentives, such as a higher income, are positively correlated for continuing to long-distance commuting more than a few years. Furthermore, the analysis shows that male commuters benefit more in terms of economic outcome of long-distance commuting. It is concluded that the trend with increasing long-distance commuting can sustain not only gender differences on the labour market but also within households. Finally, the paper indicates that long-distance commuting is a strategic mobility choice for households, rather than a short-term solution for a few years. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Availability of free, high quality Landsat data portends a new era in remote sensing change detection. Using dense ($\sim$. annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington, USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Maps of forest biomass are important tools for managing natural resources and reporting terrestrial carbon stocks. Using the San Juan National Forest in Southwest Colorado as a case study, we evaluate regional biomass maps created using physical variables, spectral vegetation indices, and image textural analysis on Landsat TM imagery. We investigate eight gray level co-occurrence matrix based texture measures (mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment and correlation) on four window sizes (3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7, 9 × 9) at four offsets ([1,0], [1,1], [0,1], [1,−1]) on four Landsat TM bands (2, 3, 4, and 5). The map with the highest prediction quality was created using three texture metrics calculated from Landsat Band 2 on a 3 × 3 window and an offset of [0,1]: entropy, mean and correlation; and one physical variable: slope. The correlation of predicted versus observed biomass values for our texture-based biomass map is r = 0.86, the Root Mean Square Error is 45.6 Mg∙ha−1, and the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error is 0.31. We find that models including image texture variables are more strongly correlated with biomass than models using only physical and spectral variables. Additionally, we suggest that the use of texture appears to better capture the magnitude and direction of biomass change following disturbance compared to spectral approaches. The biomass mapping methods we present here are widely applicable throughout the US, as they are based on publically available datasets and utilize relatively simple analytical routines.},

This paper quantifies the classification accuracy of single band density slicing of Landsat 5 TM data to delineate water bodies on riverine floodplains. The results of these analyses are then compared to a 6-band maximum likelihood classification over the same area. The water boundaries delineated by each of these digital classification procedures were compared to water boundaries delineated from colour aerial photography acquired on the same day as the TM data. These comparisons show that Landsat TM data can be used to map water bodies accurately. Density slicing of the single mid-infrared band 5 proved as successful as multispectral classification achieving an overall accuracy of 96.9%, a producer's accuracy for water bodies of 81.7% and a user's accuracy for water bodies of 64.5%.},

This study focuses on analyzing the performance of three popular networks: Alex Net, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50. We have taken three most popular data sets ImageNet, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 for our study, since, testing the performance of a network on a single data set does not reveal its true capability and limitations. It must be noted that videos are not used as a training dataset, they are used as testing datasets. Our analysis shows that GoogLeNet and ResNet50 are able to recognize objects with better precision compared to Alex Net. Moreover, theperformance of trained CNN's vary substantially across different categories of objects and we, therefore, will discuss the possible reasons for this.},

However, almost all the existing very deep convolutional neural networks are trained on the giant ImageNet datasets. Small datasets like CIFAR-10 has rarely taken advantage of the power of depth since deep models are easy to overfit. In this paper, we proposed a modified VGG-16 network and used this model to fit CIFAR-10. By adding stronger regularizer and using Batch Normalization, we achieved 8.45% error rate on CIFAR-10 without severe overfitting. Our results show that the very deep CNN can be used to fit small datasets with simple and proper modifications and don't need to re-design specific small networks. We believe that if a model is strong enough to fit a large dataset, it can also fit a small one.},

abstract = {In the present paper, a test of the spectral variation hypothesis (SVH) was performed using multispectral high resolution satellite data. The SVH was tested by comparing the relationship between the spectral heterogeneity and species richness in plots of different size (100-10000 m2) in a complex wetland ecosystem, the "Montepulciano Lake", Central Italy. The nature reserve of the Montepulciano Lake is centered on a 100 ha shallow lake surrounded on three sides by a Phragmites australis and Carex sp. pl. marsh of about 280 ha. The monitoring program for the reserve vegetation started in 2002 and is based on the analysis of 1, 100 m2 and 1 ha (10000 m 2) plots, organized in such a manner that four of the smaller size plots are nested, following a random design, within a larger one. Data on species composition and community structure were collected in the plots and stored in a GIS-linked archive. A multispectral Quickbird satellite image (3 m spatial resolution) acquired of the wetland and lake ecosystem during the same period was radiometrically and geometrically corrected. We performed an analysis to examine the use of spectral heterogeneity using the four visible and infrared wavebands of the satellite image to predict species richness at the different spatial scales. The spectral heterogeneity was found to explain about 20% of the variance of species richness at the 100 m2 scale and about 50% at the 1 ha scale. It was concluded that multispectral high resolution satellite data can contribute to the biodiversity assessment of complex wetland ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

@article{Nagendra2001,
abstract = {This review paper evaluates the potential of remote sensing for assessing species diversity, an increasingly urgent task. Existing studies of species distribution patterns using remote sensing can be essentially categorized into three types. The ? rst involves direct mapping of individual plants or associations of single species in relatively large, spatially contiguous units. The second tech- nique involves habitat mapping using remotely sensed data, and predictions of species distribution based on habitat requirements. Finally, establishment of direct relationships between spectral radiance values recorded from remote sensors and species distribution patterns recorded from ? eld observations may assist in assessing species diversity. Direct mapping is applicable over smaller extents, for detailed information on the distribution of certain canopy tree species or associ- ations. Estimations of relationships between spectral values and species distribu- tions may be useful for the limited purpose of indicating areas with higher levels of species diversity, and can be applied over spatial extents of hundreds of square kilometres. Habitat maps appear most capable of providing information on the distributions of large numbers of species in a wider variety of habitat types. This is strongly limited by variation in species composition, and best applied over limited spatial extents of tens of square kilometres},

abstract = {Stretching over 4300 km north to south, Chile is a special country with complicated landscapes and rich biodiversity. Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.},

The most commonly used such\nproducts are wild spinaches, fuelwood, wooden utensils edible fruits,\ngrass hand-brushes, and twig hand-brushes, used by 85% or more of\nhouseholds. More than half the households investigated also make use of\nedible insects, wood for construction, bushmeat, wild honey and reeds\nfor weaving. Individual households may exploit dozens of animal and\nplant species. The range in annual, direct-use values is large, from\nless than 81000 per household per year to over R12 000. The value to\nrural households is manifest through a daily net function which\nrepresents a cost saving to the families involved and to the state, as\nwell as through an emergency net, which serves as an insurance in times\nof misfortune, such as drought, disease, and unexpected economic\nhardship. The emergency net function has hardly been quantified in South\nAfrica and internationally. Ad hoc trade in NTFPs is a common emergency\nnet, which in some instances evolves into a permanent way of life.\nFinancial returns from trade are variable, depending on resource type\nand hours worked, but are typically low. Despite the small cash incomes\nfrom trade, they provide an important contribution that complement the\ndiverse livelihood strategies within a household, especially for the\npoorer sectors of rural society.

Accurate LULC map offers detail information for resources management and intergovernmental cooperation to debate global warming and biodiversity reduction. This paper examined effects of pansharpening and atmospheric correction on LULC classification. Object-Based Support Vector Machine (OB-SVM) and Pixel-Based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (PB-MLC) were applied for LULC classification. Results showed that atmospheric correction is not necessary for LULC classification if it is conducted in the original multispectral image. Nevertheless, pansharpening plays much more important roles on the classification accuracy than the atmospheric correction. It can help to increase classification accuracy by 12% on average compared to the ones without pansharpening. PB-MLC and OB-SVM achieved similar classification rate. This study indicated that the LULC classification accuracy using PB-MLC and OB-SVM is 82% and 89% respectively. A combination of atmospheric correction, pansharpening, and OB-SVM could offer promising LULC maps from WorldView-2 multispectral and panchromatic images.},

abstract = {This paper presents a pilot study on riparian vegetation delineation and mapping using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) in the Hunter Region, Australia. The aim of the study was to develop appropriate and repeatable assessment and mapping techniques to quantify the extent of riparian vegetation within the region. Ortho-rectified digital aerial photographs, SPOT-4 multispectral (XS) and Landsat-7 ETM+ images were tested to delineate the riparian vegetation and to develop a quantifiable and repeatable method of mapping the extent of that vegetation. Image processing techniques such as parallelepiped classification, tasselled cap transformation, and vegetation index clustering were used in an attempt to delineate riparian vegetation from remotely sensed images. Specific GIS analysis techniques were used for riparian zone buffering and segmentation, vegetation cover estimation, and mapping. Specific GIS scripts were developed for those processes so that they were automatic, fast, and repeatable. Various vegetation indices (VI) were evaluated and compared for their ability to discriminate riparian vegetation and its extent. The riparian vegetation was assessed and mapped at designed segmental interval (e.g. 1{\^{A}} km) with polygon and lineal representations. The classification accuracy was assessed against field observation and air photo interpretation (API). The overall accuracy of the photo-based classification was about 81%, SPOT-4 63%, and Landsat-7 ETM+ 53%. Statistic analysis shows that there is little agreement between photo-based classification and that from satellite imagery.},

abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10. m to 60. m depending on the spectral band with a 290. km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Digital data on the position and characteristics of river networks and catchments are important for the analysis of pressures and impacts on water resources. GIS tools allow for the combined analysis of digital elevation data and environmental parameters in order to derive this kind of information. This article presents a new approach making use of medium-resolution digital elevation data (250-m grid cell size) and information on climate, vegetation cover, terrain morphology, soils and lithology to derive river networks and catchments over extended areas. In general, methods to extract channel networks at small scale use a constant threshold for the critical contributing area, independent of widely varying landscape conditions. As a consequence, the resulting drainage network does not reflect the natural variability in drainage density. To overcome this limitation, a classification of the landscape is proposed. The various data available are analysed in an integrated approach in order to characterise the terrain with respect to its ability to develop lower or higher drainage densities, resulting in five landscape types. For each landscape type, the slope-area relationship is then derived and the critical contributing area is determined. In the subsequent channel extraction, a dedicated critical contributing area threshold is used for each landscape type. The described methodology has been developed and tested for the territory of Italy. Results have been validated comparing the derived data with river and catchment data sets from other sources and at varying scales. Good agreement both in terms of river superimposition and drainage density could be demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Certini2005,
abstract = {Many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties can be affected by forest fires. The effects are chiefly a result of burn severity, which consists of peak temperatures and duration of the fire. Climate, vegetation, and topography of the burnt area control the resilience of the soil system; some fire-induced changes can even be permanent. Low to moderate severity fires, such as most of those prescribed in forest management, promote renovation of the dominant vegetation through elimination of undesired species and transient increase of pH and available nutrients. No irreversible ecosystem change occurs, but the enhancement of hydrophobicity can render the soil less able to soak up water and more prone to erosion. Severe fires, such as wildfires, generally have several negative effects on soil. They cause significant removal of organic matter, deterioration of both structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilisation, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, and marked alteration of both quantity and specific composition of microbial and soil-dwelling invertebrate communities. However, despite common perceptions, if plants succeed in promptly recolonising the burnt area, the pre-fire level of most properties can be recovered and even enhanced. This work is a review of the up-to-date literature dealing with changes imposed by fires on properties of forest soils. Ecological implications of these changes are described.},

abstract = {Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) withdrawal is a well-recognized complication when drug delivery is disrupted for any reason. ITB withdrawal varies widely in its severity and poses the very real possibility of death if not promptly managed. Cases of withdrawal lasting greater than 1 or 2 weeks, however, are sparse. We report the case of an 11-year-old girl with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy who developed an infected pump and subsequent meningitis, prompting the removal of her pump and catheter. She subsequently developed a severe, prolonged baclofen withdrawal syndrome marked by increased spasticity, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia that lasted nearly 2 months, requiring intensive care and continuous intravenous sedation with benzodiazepines and opiates. Her pump was eventually replaced on hospital day 56 and within 24 hours her symptoms dramatically improved. She was eventually weaned off sedating medications and returned to baseline functional status. Typical management of baclofen withdrawal is reviewed. To date, the literature has not discussed the potential role for opiates in managing baclofen withdrawal, yet a growing body of literature is examining the interplay between opiates and gamma-aminobutyric acid B pathways. A potential role for opiates in managing severe baclofen withdrawal is proposed.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

abstract = {The topographic wetness index (TWI, ln(a/tan )), which combines local upslope contributing area and slope, is commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes. Methods of computing this index differ primarily in the way the upslope contributing area is calculated. In this study we compared a number of calculation methods for TWI and evaluated them in terms of their correlation with the following measured variables: vascular plant species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, soil moisture, and a constructed wetness degree. The TWI was calculated by varying six parameters affecting the distribution of accumulated area among downslope cells and by varying the way the slope was calculated. All possible combinations of these parameters were calculated for two separate boreal forest sites in northern Sweden. We did not find a calculation method that performed best for all measured variables; rather the best methods seemed to be variable and site specific. However, we were able to identify some general characteristics of the best methods for different groups of measured variables. The results provide guiding principles for choosing the best method for estimating species richness, soil pH, groundwater level, and soil moisture by the TWI derived from digital elevation models.},

This research evaluates the use of high spatial resolution (IKONOS) and medium spatial resolution (Landsat ETM+) satellite imagery for assessing vegetation diversity in a dry tropical forest in central India. Contrary to expectations, across multiple measures of plant distribution and diversity, the resolution of IKONOS data is too fine for the purpose of plant diversity assessment and Landsat imagery performs better.},

In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR- 10 (4.62% error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.},

@article{Armesto2010,
abstract = {The main forest transitions that took place in south-central Chile from the end of the last glaciation to the present are reviewed here with the aim of identifying the main climatic and socio-economic drivers of land cover change. The first great transition, driven primarily by global warming, is the postglacial expansion of forests, with human populations from about 15,000 cal. yr. BP, restricted to coastlines and river basins and localized impact of forest fire. Charcoal evidence of fire increased in south-central Chile and in global records from about 12,000 to 6000 cal. yr. BP, which could be attributed at least partly to people. The subsequent expansion of agriculture led to much clearing of forests and the spread of weeds and other indicators of open habitats. The Spanish colonial period in America may have been followed by a transient expansion of forest cover into abandoned land, as indigenous population declined rapidly due to disease and slaughter. The 18th and 19th centuries brought about extensive loss of forests due to the massive impact of lumber extraction for mining operations both in central Chile and in western North America. Two centuries of intensive deforestation, coupled to grazing by cattle and extremely variable rainfall had long-lasting effects on forest cover in south-central Chile, which persist until today. The transition from a preindustrial to an industrial society brought about the "golden age" of timber harvest, assisted by mobile sawmills and railway transportation since the late 1800s. These advances led to the exhaustion of native commercial timber by the late 20th century in south-central Chile. In North America, harvestable stands were exhausted in New England and the Midwest around 1920. Settlement of the independent territories in the late 1800s and early 1900s implied vast burning and clearing of land and mounting soil erosion. Industrial forestry, based on government-subsidized massive plantations of short-rotation exotic trees, developed in the late 20th century, in connection with postindustrial displacement of exploitative activities from developed to third-world nations. In the last two decades, economic globalization and free trade promoted the expansion of new crops and further decline of woodlands, despite modest increases in forest cover. These patterns are repeated in many Latin American countries. To prevent further depletion of native forest resources and to provide an insurance against climate change, in the 21st century developing nations should aim at: (1) relocating subsidies from fiber farms to restoring diverse forest cover, (2) promoting ecosystem management of diverse forest and crops within landscapes, and (3) fostering diverse cultural relationships between people and their land. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of modeling tools available to examine future land-use and land-cover (LULC) change. Integrated modeling frameworks, agent-based models, cellular automata approaches, and other modeling techniques have substantially improved the representation of complex LULC systems, with each method using a different strategy to address complexity. However, despite the development of new and better modeling tools, the use of these tools is limited for actual planning, decision-making, or policy-making purposes. LULC modelers have become very adept at creating tools for modeling LULC change, but complicated models and lack of transparency limit their utility for decision-makers. The complicated nature of many LULC models also makes it impractical or even impossible to perform a rigorous analysis of modeling uncertainty. This paper provides a review of land-cover modeling approaches and the issues causes by the complicated nature of models, and provides suggestions to facilitate the increased use of LULC models by decision-makers and other stakeholders. The utility of LULC models themselves can be improved by 1) providing model code and documentation, 2) through the use of scenario frameworks to frame overall uncertainties, 3) improving methods for generalizing key LULC processes most important to stakeholders, and 4) adopting more rigorous standards for validating models and quantifying uncertainty. Communication with decision-makers and other stakeholders can be improved by increasing stakeholder participation in all stages of the modeling process, increasing the transparency of model structure and uncertainties, and developing user-friendly decision-support systems to bridge the link between LULC science and policy. By considering these options, LULC science will be better positioned to support decision-makers and increase real-world application of LULC modeling results. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

One proposed mechanism linking\nobesity to chronic diseases is an alteration in adipose-derived\nadiponectin and leptin levels. We investigated the effects of 12-month\nreduced calorie, weight loss and exercise interventions on adiponectin\nand leptin concentrations.\nMethodsOverweight/obese postmenopausal women (n=439) were randomized as\nfollows: (i) a reduced calorie, weight-loss diet (diet; N=118), (ii)\nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (exercise; N=117), (iii)\na combination of a reduced calorie, weight-loss diet and\nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (diet+exercise; N=117),\nand (iv) control (N=87). The reduced calorie diet had a 10% weight-loss\ngoal. The exercise intervention consisted of 45min of\nmoderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity 5days per week. Adiponectin and\nleptin levels were measured at baseline and after 12months of\nintervention using a radioimmunoassay.\nResultsAdiponectin increased by 9.5% in the diet group and 6.6% in the\ndiet+exercise group (both P0.0001 vs. control). Compared with controls,\nleptin decreased with all interventions (diet+exercise, -40.1%,\nP<0.0001; diet, -27.1%, P<0.0001; exercise, -12.7%, P=0.005).

abstract = {Large, high-severity wildfires remove vegetation cover and expose mineral soil, ofen causing ero- sion and runoff during postfire rain events to increase dramatically. Land-management agencies in the United States are required to assess site conditions after wildfire and, where necessary, implement emergency water- shed rehabilitation measures to help stabilize soil; control movement of water, sediment, and debris; prevent permanent impairment of ecosystem structure and function; and mitigate significant threats to human health, safety, life, property, or downstream values. One of the most common postfire treatments is broadcast seeding of grasses, usually from aircraft. Non-native annual or perennial grasses typically are used to provide quick, temporary ground cover to hold soil in place until native plants are reestablished. Critics argue that seeded grasses compete with native vegetation and do not effectively reduce erosion. Fewdata exist on the effectiveness of erosion control; less than half of the studies I reviewed showed reduced sediment movement with seeding. In all vegetation types, successful growth of seeded grasses—enough to affect erosion—appears to displace native or naturalized species, including shrub and tree seedlings. Due to the competitiveness of seeded grasses, they are used to attempt suppression of noxious weeds in some postfire seeding operations. In burned sagebrush range, postfire seeding is frequently used to replace non-native cheatgrass ( Bromus tectorum) with native or introduced bunchgrasses, with at least short-term success. In recent years, native species and sterile cereal grains have increasingly been used for seeding. Use of aerially applied straw mulch has increased as well, with the risk of weed introduction from contaminated bales. More research on the effectiveness and ecosystem impacts of these alternatives is needed.},

abstract = {This book addresses the socio-economic impacts of rapid economic development due to a global mining boom. It reviews the efforts taken by communities, governments and companies in Australia to deliver enduring benefits while minimising the negative consequences of rapid growth. In particular, the effects and tensions of new workforce arrangements, worker mobility and condensed mine life cycles on communities and economies are explored. Split into two parts, the first part of the book details various issues related to the socio-economic impacts of Labour Force Mobility and Rapid Economic Growth, while the second part focuses on measuring the socio-economic impacts of Rapid Economic Growth. Chapter contributors have technical and scientific backgrounds which have been informed by social perspectives. They understand the technical and economic spheres of the resources industries and recognize the gaps in the public policy which hinder regional economic development during a period of extraordinary growth and opportunity. The book is a useful resource for practitioners in the public policy, resources, community planning and economic development sectors as well as students in business, regional planning and human resources.},

abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10. m to 60. m depending on the spectral band with a 290. km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus(genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

@article{Goodenough2012a,
abstract = {Despite recent papers on problems associated with full-model and stepwise regression, their use is still common throughout ecological and environmental disciplines. Alternative approaches, including generating multiple models and comparing them post-hoc using techniques such as Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), are becoming more popular. However, these are problematic when there are numerous independent variables and interpretation is often difficult when competing models contain many different variables and combinations of variables. Here, we detail a new approach, REVS (Regression with Empirical Variable Selection), which uses all-subsets regression to quantify empirical support for every independent variable. A series of models is created; the first containing the variable with most empirical support, the second containing the first variable and the next most-supported, and so on. The comparatively small number of resultant models (n = the number of predictor variables) means that post-hoc comparison is comparatively quick and easy. When tested on a real dataset--habitat and offspring quality in the great tit (Parus major)--the optimal REVS model explained more variance (higher R(2)), was more parsimonious (lower AIC), and had greater significance (lower P values), than full, stepwise or all-subsets models; it also had higher predictive accuracy based on split-sample validation. Testing REVS on ten further datasets suggested that this is typical, with R(2) values being higher than full or stepwise models (mean improvement = 31% and 7%, respectively). Results are ecologically intuitive as even when there are several competing models, they share a set of "core" variables and differ only in presence/absence of one or two additional variables. We conclude that REVS is useful for analysing complex datasets, including those in ecology and environmental disciplines.},

abstract = {Maps of forest biomass are important tools for managing natural resources and reporting terrestrial carbon stocks. Using the San Juan National Forest in Southwest Colorado as a case study, we evaluate regional biomass maps created using physical variables, spectral vegetation indices, and image textural analysis on Landsat TM imagery. We investigate eight gray level co-occurrence matrix based texture measures (mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment and correlation) on four window sizes (3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7, 9 × 9) at four offsets ([1,0], [1,1], [0,1], [1,−1]) on four Landsat TM bands (2, 3, 4, and 5). The map with the highest prediction quality was created using three texture metrics calculated from Landsat Band 2 on a 3 × 3 window and an offset of [0,1]: entropy, mean and correlation; and one physical variable: slope. The correlation of predicted versus observed biomass values for our texture-based biomass map is r = 0.86, the Root Mean Square Error is 45.6 Mg∙ha−1, and the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error is 0.31. We find that models including image texture variables are more strongly correlated with biomass than models using only physical and spectral variables. Additionally, we suggest that the use of texture appears to better capture the magnitude and direction of biomass change following disturbance compared to spectral approaches. The biomass mapping methods we present here are widely applicable throughout the US, as they are based on publically available datasets and utilize relatively simple analytical routines.},

abstract = {There is currently a great deal of interest in the quantitative characterization of temporal and spatial vegetation patterns with remotely sensed data for the study of earth system science and global change. Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the L factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant L in the SAVI equation with a variable L function is presented in this article. The L function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a “vegetation signal” to “soil noise” ratio.},

@article{Sohl2013a,
abstract = {The last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of modeling tools available to examine future land-use and land-cover (LULC) change. Integrated modeling frameworks, agent-based models, cellular automata approaches, and other modeling techniques have substantially improved the representation of complex LULC systems, with each method using a different strategy to address complexity. However, despite the development of new and better modeling tools, the use of these tools is limited for actual planning, decision-making, or policy-making purposes. LULC modelers have become very adept at creating tools for modeling LULC change, but complicated models and lack of transparency limit their utility for decision-makers. The complicated nature of many LULC models also makes it impractical or even impossible to perform a rigorous analysis of modeling uncertainty. This paper provides a review of land-cover modeling approaches and the issues causes by the complicated nature of models, and provides suggestions to facilitate the increased use of LULC models by decision-makers and other stakeholders. The utility of LULC models themselves can be improved by 1) providing model code and documentation, 2) through the use of scenario frameworks to frame overall uncertainties, 3) improving methods for generalizing key LULC processes most important to stakeholders, and 4) adopting more rigorous standards for validating models and quantifying uncertainty. Communication with decision-makers and other stakeholders can be improved by increasing stakeholder participation in all stages of the modeling process, increasing the transparency of model structure and uncertainties, and developing user-friendly decision-support systems to bridge the link between LULC science and policy. By considering these options, LULC science will be better positioned to support decision-makers and increase real-world application of LULC modeling results. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

@article{Ulanowski2013a,
abstract = {The Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) of northern Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, Canada is the second largest contiguous peatland complex in the world, currently containing more than half of Canada's soil carbon. Recent concerns about the ecohydrological impacts to these large northern peatlands resulting from climate change and resource extraction have catalyzed a resurgence in scientific research into this ecologically important region. However, the sheer size, heterogeneity and elaborate landscape arrangements of this ecosystem raise important questions concerning representative sampling of environmental media for chemical or physical characterization. To begin to quantify such variability, this study assessed the small-scale spatial (1m) and short temporal (21 day) variability of surface pore-water biogeochemistry (pH, dissolved organic carbon, and major ions) in a Sphagnum spp.-dominated, ombrotrophic raised bog, and a Carex spp.-dominated intermediate fen in the HBL. In general, pore-water pH and concentrations of dissolved solutes were similar to previously reported literature values from this region. However, systematic sampling revealed consistent statistically significant differences in pore-water chemistries between the bog and fen peatland types, and large within-site spatiotemporal variability. We found that microtopography in the bog was associated with consistent differences in most biogeochemical variables. Temporal changes in dissolved solute chemistry, particularly base cations (Na(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)), were statistically significant in the intermediate fen, likely a result of a dynamic connection between surficial waters and mineral-rich deep groundwater. In both the bog and fen, concentrations of SO4(2-) showed considerable spatial variability, and a significant decrease in concentrations over the study period. The observed variability in peatland pore-water biogeochemistry over such small spatial and temporal scales suggests that under-sampling in northern peatland environments could lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the abundance and distribution of natural elements and pollutants alike.},

@article{Worrall2012a,
abstract = {Estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes resulting from sheep grazing upon upland peat soils have never been fully quantified. Previous studies have been limited to individual flux pathways or to comparing the presence to the absence of sheep grazing. Therefore, this study combines a model of the physical impact of grazing with models of: biomass production; energy usage in sheep; and peat accumulation. These combined modelling approaches enabled this study to consider the indirect and direct impacts of sheep upon the carbon and greenhouse gas balance of a peatland at different grazing intensities as well as the changes between grazing intensities. The study considered four vegetation scenarios (Calluna sp., Molinia sp.; reseeded grasses, and Agrostis-Festuca grassland) and a mixed vegetation scenario based upon the vegetation typical of upland peat ecosystems in northern England. Each scenario was considered for altitudes between 350 and 900 m above sea level and for grazing intensities between 0.1 and 2 ewes/ha. The study can show that the total GHG flux at the vegetative carrying capacity tended to decline with increasing altitude for all vegetation scenarios considered except for Molinia sp. The average total GHG flux for all scenarios was 1505 kg CO(2)eq/ha/yr/(ewe/ha), and on average 89% of the fluxes were directly from the sheep and not from the soil, and are therefore not unique to a peat soil environment. The study suggests that emission factors for upland sheep have been greatly underestimated. By comparing the total flux due to grazers to the flux to or from the soil that allows the study to define a GHG carry capacity, i.e. the grazing intensity at which the flux due to grazing is equal to the sink represented by the peat soils, this GHG carrying capacity varies between 0.2 and 1.7 ewes/ha with this capacity declining with increasing altitude for all model scenarios.},

abstract = {This study proposes a method for assessing the probability that land management interventions will lead to an improvement in the carbon sink represented by peat soils. The method is able to: combine studies of different carbon uptake and release pathways in order to assess changes on the overall carbon or greenhouse gas budget; calculate the probability of the management or restoration leading to an improvement in the budget; calculate the uncertainty in that probability estimate; estimate the equivalent number of complete budgets available from the combination of the literature; test the difference in the outcome of different land management interventions; and provide a method for updating the predicted probabilities as new studies become available. Using this methodology, this study considered the impact of: afforestation, managed burning, drainage, drain-blocking, grazing removal; and revegetation, on the carbon budget of peat soils in the UK. The study showed that afforestation, drain-blocking, revegetation, grazing removal and cessation of managed burning would bring a carbon benefit, whereas deforestation, managed burning and drainage would bring a disbenefit. The predicted probabilities of a benefit are often equivocal as each management type or restoration often leads to increase in uptake in one pathway while increasing losses in another.},

@article{Gebhardt2010a,
abstract = {The drainage of a riparian peatland interspersed with organic and mineral substrates in Northern Germany has led to subsidence morphology due to mineralisation, initial settlement and shrinkage processes causing cultivation problems and yield declines. To explain the relevancy of shrinkage to changes of the surface morphology and soil properties, organic and mineral substrates were analysed with regard to (1) shrinkage potential (i.e. the maximum shrinkage), (2) shrinkage curve, (3) actual in situ shrinkage and (4) irreversible shrinkage proportions. The investigated substrates are sedge peat, peat-clay, half-bog and alluvial sand of Fibric Limnic Histosols (Drainic) and a glacial clay for comparison. The methods used to obtain the shrinkage curves include the consideration of crack formation due to desiccation, as digital photography and image analysis were used in addition to height change measurements. To characterise the actual in situ shrinkage, continuous records of the soil matric potential for a 4.5-year period at two different intensively drained Histosols (moderately and deeply drained: mean groundwater table 0.6 and 1.7 m under ground level) were accomplished in four depths (15, 40, 70, 100 cm). The measured shrinkage potentials vary between 2% (alluvial sand) and 65% (peat-clay). The sedge peat and peat-clay are characterised by distinct higher shrinkage potentials compared to the glacial clay and show distinct proportional shrinkage. It has to be pointed out that the soil volume loss partly even exceeds the loss in water volume. The sedge peat does not reach residual or zero shrinkage but shows distinct structural shrinkage at initial desiccation. For the moderately drained site, matric potentials reached up to -60 kPa in summer in 15-cm depth, whilst capillary rise almost prevented desiccation of deeper zones. For the deeply drained site, summer desiccation reached deeper zones as well (matric potential up to -50 kPa in 40-cm depth) due to absent capillary rise. In the range of actually occurring maximum desiccation, the half-bog and peat-clay with high decomposed organic matter are particularly affected by shrinkage with volume decreases of 10-14%, in contrast to the fibred sedge peat with only 4%. When uniquely shrunken substrates will be re-wetted, distinct irreversible shrinkage proportions reaching between 18% and 31% subsequent to drying to a matric potential of -50 kPa and re-saturation were measured. Particularly, the organic-rich substrates appeared as characteristically sensitive to soil shrinkage. Contrary to mineral substrates, they lack in solid particles, leading, along with high hydraulic stresses due to dominantly finer pores, to intense volume decreases after desiccation. These substrates therefore partly also lack in residual or zero shrinkage, and the soil volume loss can even exceed the water loss due to shrinkage. Accordingly, the alterations of soil properties, e.g. conductivities, are especially pronounced. The calculated proportion of actual in situ shrinkage (0.5 to 1 dm) to total subsidence of the investigated peatland is rather low for the deeply drained site in comparison to initial settlement (2-3 dm) and long-term active mineralisation (e.g. 4 dm in 40 years, mineralisation rate 1 cm year(-1)) but accelerates the latter because of enhanced aeration due to crack formation. Irreversible shrinkage is one reason why re-wetted fen peats do not retrieve their initial volume as well as their initial physical and hydraulic properties. Thus, a re-wetting of drained fen peats can only preserve the present condition. To impede the further impairment of riparian peatlands, it is necessary to maintain a near-surface water table particularly throughout the summer months, when high desiccation occurs, leading to a spatially differentiated proportion of initial settlement, shrinkage and mineralisation, causing subsidence morphology. Our recommendation is a drainage depth of less than 60 cm to enable pasture or grassland land use and to minimise mineralisation as well as structure formation in the (sub)soil.},

abstract = {Aggregate hierarchy and porosity changes in aggregate beds as a consequence of wetting-drying cycles were studied in two Andisols and one Mollisol from Chile, collected at two depths. Bulk density and indirect tensile strength were measured in aggregates of different sizes. Aggregate beds were prepared in cylinders with two size classes. Six wetting-drying cycles between 0 and -60 hPa were applied. Bulk density (Db) of soil matrix was controlled after each cycle, and the macroporosity was calculated. A repellency index was measured in one of the Andisols. In addition, also the air permeability was measured after the sixth cycle. It could be proofed, that the aggregate strength is an appropriate parameter to evaluate the aggregate hierarchy, and this parameter is also more sensitive than aggregate Db to discriminate between the effects of land-use intensity. Aggregate strength is furthermore well correlated with changes in pore water pressure and can be applied to relate strength values with aggregate development level. Only if the predrying exceeds pF > 3.0, aggregate strength correlates with Db. The more pronounced is the land-use, the higher is the increase of Db values for aggregate beds. The decrease of coarse porosity during wetting-drying cycles can be explained by mass differences between saturated and equilibrated water conditions that considers the water around aggregates and within the contact area. Nevertheless, the relation of relative macroporosity change, calculated by P-exped where D-agg IS the Db measured by clod method, and the relative Db change, is useful to explain possible presence of coarse pores inside the aggregates. The newly formed porosity prevents the water repellency, but after six cycles of drying, the repellency index increased in the topsoil while we could detect a decrease in the subsoil samples (under defined conditions in the laboratory) which we assume to be caused by microbial activity. The approaching of aggregates by drying cycles generates in Andisols a reduced area to air fluxes, with low values of air permeability.},

@article{Hansen2003a,
abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance (438 to 884 nm) data were recorded at five different growth stages of winter wheat in a field experiment including two cultivars, three plant densities, and four levels of N application. All two-band combinations in the normalized difference vegetation index (??1 - ??2)/(??1 + ??2) were subsequently used in a linear regression analysis against green biomass (GBM, g fresh weight m
                        -2 soil), leaf area index (LAI, m
                        2 green leaf m
                        -2 soil), leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chl
                        conc, mg chlorophyll g 
                        -1 leaf fresh weight), leaf chlorophyll density (Chl 
                        density, mg chlorophyll m
                        -2 soil), leaf nitrogen concentration (N
                        conc, mg nitrogen g
                        -1 leaf dry weight), and leaf nitrogen density (N
                        density, g nitrogen m
                        -2 soil). A number of grouped wavebands with high correlation (R
                        2>95%) were revealed. For the crop variables based on quantity per unit surface area, i.e. GBM, LAI, Chl
                        density, and N
                        density, these wavebands had in the majority (87%) of the cases a center wavelength in the red edge spectral region from 680 to 750 nm and the band combinations were often paired so that both bands were closely spaced in the steep linear shift between R 
                        red and R
                        nir. The red edge region was almost absent for bands related to Chl
                        conc and N
                        conc, where the visible spectral range, mainly in the blue region, proved to be better. The selected narrow-band indices improved the description of the influence of all six-crop variables compared to the traditional broad- and short-band indices normally applied on data from satellite, aerial photos, and field spectroradiometers. For variables expressed on the basis of soil or canopy surface area, the relationship was further improved when exponential curve fitting was used instead of linear regression. The best of the selected narrow-band indices was compared to the results of a partial least square regression (PLS). This comparison showed that the narrow-band indices related to LAI and Chl 
                        conc, and to some extent also Chl
                        density and N 
                        density, were optimal and could not be significantly improved by PLS using the information from all wavelengths in the hyperspectral region. However, PLS improved the prediction of GBM and N
                        conc by lowering the RMSE with 22% and 24%, respectively, compared to the best narrow-band indices. It is concluded that PLS regression analysis may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool when applied on hyperspectral reflectance data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Thoroughly revised and reorganised, this new edition of this prize-winning textbook begins with underlying causal factors, before moving on to more advanced concepts that add depth and context. Each chapter begins with an explanation of the basic principles covered, illustrated with clear examples. More difficult concepts and exceptions are introduced only once the general principle is well-established. Key principles are now discussed at the beginning of the book, and in order of relative importance, enabling students to understand the most important material without wading through complex theory. New chapters on wetland restoration and wetland services draw upon practical examples from around the world, providing a global context, and a new chapter on research will be particularly relevant to the advanced student planning their own studies.},

@article{Chao2006a,
abstract = {A wide variety of similarity indices for comparing two assemblages based on species incidence (i.e., presence/absence) data have been proposed in the literature. These indices are generally based on three simple incidence counts: the number of species shared by two assemblages and the number of species unique to each of them. We provide a new probabilistic derivation for any incidence-based index that is symmetric (i.e., the index is not affected by the identity ordering of the two assemblages) and homogeneous (i.e., the index is unchanged if all counts are multiplied by a constant). The probabilistic approach is further extended to formulate abundance-based indices. Thus any symmetric and homogeneous incidence index can be easily modified to an abundance-type version. Applying the Laplace approximation formulas, we propose estimators that adjust for the effect of unseen shared species on our abundance-based indices. Simulation results show that the adjusted estimators significantly reduce the biases of the corresponding unadjusted ones when a substantial fraction of species is missing from samples. Data on successional vegetation in six tropical forests are used for illustration. Advantages and disadvantages of some commonly applied indices are briefly discussed.},

@article{Certini2005a,
abstract = {Many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties can be affected by forest fires. The effects are chiefly a result of burn severity, which consists of peak temperatures and duration of the fire. Climate, vegetation, and topography of the burnt area control the resilience of the soil system; some fire-induced changes can even be permanent. Low to moderate severity fires, such as most of those prescribed in forest management, promote renovation of the dominant vegetation through elimination of undesired species and transient increase of pH and available nutrients. No irreversible ecosystem change occurs, but the enhancement of hydrophobicity can render the soil less able to soak up water and more prone to erosion. Severe fires, such as wildfires, generally have several negative effects on soil. They cause significant removal of organic matter, deterioration of both structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilisation, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, and marked alteration of both quantity and specific composition of microbial and soil-dwelling invertebrate communities. However, despite common perceptions, if plants succeed in promptly recolonising the burnt area, the pre-fire level of most properties can be recovered and even enhanced. This work is a review of the up-to-date literature dealing with changes imposed by fires on properties of forest soils. Ecological implications of these changes are described.},
